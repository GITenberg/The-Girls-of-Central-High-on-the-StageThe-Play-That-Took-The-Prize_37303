<h1>THE GIRLS OF CENTRAL HIGH ON THE STAGE</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—WHAT THE M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’S NEEDED</h2>
<p>
The M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. house was alight from cellar
to garret. It was the first big reception of the
winter and followed closely the end of the first
basketball trophy series and the football game
between the Central High team and that of
West High.
</p>
<p>
The M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. was the only girls’ secret society
countenanced by Franklin Sharp, the principal
of Central High. Until you belonged to
it you never knew what the three initials stood
for; after you were lucky enough to belong, the
name of the society became such a deep and dark
mystery that you never dared whisper it, even to
your very closest “spoon.”
</p>
<p>
Therefore, in all probability, we shall never
learn just what “M. O. R.” stands for.
</p>
<p>
Among the boys of Central High, their sisters
and the other girls belonging to the secret
society were spoken of as “Mothers of the Republic.”
But the boys were only jealous. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
were entirely shut out of the doings of the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’s,
which long antedated the Girls’ Branch
Athletic League; the boys never were allowed
within the sacred precincts of the “House” save
on the occasion of the special reception at
Easter.
</p>
<p>
The house was a narrow slice of brownstone
front in the middle of a block of similar dwellings,
within sight of the schoolhouse, and in the
Hill section of Centerport. The Hill was supposed
to be very exclusive, and rents were high.
And the rental of the thirteen-foot slice of
brownstone had become a serious problem to the
Board of Governors of the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.
</p>
<p>
Some M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’s had gone to college, many
of them had married, some had moved many,
many miles away from Centerport. But most of
them remembered tenderly the first school society
of which they had been members. The
alumnae were loyal to M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.
</p>
<p>
And some of the alumnae were on the present
Board of Governors, and were—on this reception
night—discussing seriously with the more
active members of the board the financial state
of the society. The owner of the house had
notified them of a raise in rent for the coming
year to an absolutely impossible figure. The
M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’s must look for new quarters.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
“If we could only interest the pupils of Central
High, as a whole, members and those who
are not in the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.,” sighed Mrs. Mabel
Kerrick.
</p>
<p>
The presence of this widowed lady, daughter
of one of the wealthiest men in Centerport, and
an alumna of the school, upon the Board of
Governors of the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. needs an explanation
that must be deferred.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how we can interest the boys—they
only make fun,” said a very bright looking
girl sitting upon the other side of the room, and
beside another very bright looking girl who
looked so much like her (they were dressed just
alike) that unless one had seen her lips move one
could never have told whether Dora Lockwood,
or Dorothy Lockwood, had spoken.
</p>
<p>
“And how are you going to interest the girls
who haven’t been asked to join the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.—and
are not likely to be asked?” demanded the
other twin. “The very exclusiveness of the society
makes it impossible for us to call upon the
school in general for help.”
</p>
<p>
“Just raise the fees and we can pay the higher
rent,” remarked another girl, briskly.
</p>
<p>
“And then, at the end of next year, Mr.
Chumley will raise it again. He owns more
rentable property than any other man on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
Hill, and just as soon as he is sure his tenant is
settled he begins to put up the rent on him,” observed
a fourth girl.
</p>
<p>
“That is just it,” Mrs. Kerrick responded,
slowly. “The society should not pay rent. We
should own our own house. We should build.
We should raise a goodly sum of money this
winter toward the building fund. But we must
find some method of interesting everybody in
our need.
</p>
<p>
“A membership in the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. has always
been a reward of merit. Freshmen cannot, of
course, be ‘touched’ for the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R., and few
sophomores attain that enviable eminence. But
by the time a girl has reached her senior year
at Central High it is her own fault if she is not
a member.
</p>
<p>
“Therefore, the girls of the younger classes
should be interested in the stability of the society,
irrespective of whether they are members
yet, or not. And naturally, if the girls are interested,
they can interest their brothers and their
parents.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose, Mrs. Kerrick, a girl hasn’t any
brothers?” demurely asked a quiet girl in the
corner.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, then, Nellie Agnew!” said the
lady, laughing. “You go and interest some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
other girl’s brother. But we haven’t heard from
little Mother Wit,” added Mrs. Kerrick, turning
suddenly to a pretty, plump girl, all in brown
and with shining hair and eyes, who sat by herself
at the far end of the room. “Haven’t you
a thing to say, Laura Belding?”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t it be a little difficult,” asked the girl
addressed, diffidently, “to invent anything that
will interest everybody in the building fund of
the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what we’re all saying, Laura,” said
one of the other members of the Board. “Now
you invent something!”
</p>
<p>
“You give me a hard task,” laughed the
brown girl. “Of course, all members—both
active and graduate—will be interested for their
membership’s sake. The problem is, then, in
addition, to interest, first, the girls who <em>may</em> be
members, and, second, the boys and general public
who can never be members of the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.”
</p>
<p>
“Logically put, Laura,” urged Mrs. Kerrick.
“Then what?”
</p>
<p>
“Why wouldn’t a play fill the bill?” asked
Laura. “Offer a prize for an original play
written by a girl of Central High, irrespective
of class or whether she is an M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. or not—that
will interest the girls in general. Have the
play presented by boys and girls of the school—that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
will hold the boys. And the parents and
general public can help by paying to see the performance.”
</p>
<p>
The younger members of the committee looked
at one another doubtfully; but Mrs. Kerrick
clapped her hands enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
“A play! The very thing! And Mr. Sharp
will approve that, no doubt. We will appoint
him chief of the committee to decide upon the
play. And we will offer a prize big enough to
make it worth while for every girl to try her
best to produce a good one.”
</p>
<p>
“But that prize must be deducted from the
profits of the performance,” objected the practical
Nellie Agnew.
</p>
<p>
“No,” replied Mrs. Kerrick, promptly. “That
will be my gift. <em>I</em> will offer the prize—two hundred
dollars—for the best play submitted before
New Year’s. How is that? Do you think it
will ‘take’? Come, Laura, does your inventive
genius approve of that suggestion?”
</p>
<p>
“I think it is very lovely of you, Mrs. Kerrick,”
cried Mother Wit. “Oh, my! Two hundred
dollars! It is magnificent. Let us find Mr.
Sharp at once and see if he approves. He is
still in the house, I know,” and at her suggestion
somebody was sent to hunt for the principal of
Central High, who was one of the guests of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
honor of the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. on this particular evening.
</p>
<p>
Centerport was a lively, wealthy inland city
situated on the shore of Lake Luna, and boasting
three high schools within its precincts. The
new building of Central High was much finer
and larger than the East and West Highs, and
there was considerable rivalry between the girls
of the three schools, not only in athletic matters,
but in all other affairs. Out of school hours,
basketball and other athletics had pretty well
filled the minds of the girls of Central High;
and Laura Belding and her particular chums had
been as active in these inter-school athletics as
any.
</p>
<p>
In fact, it was Mother Wit, as her friends and
schoolmates called Laura, who interested Colonel
Richard Swayne, Mrs. Kerrick’s father, in
the matter of girls’ athletics and so made possible
for the girls of Central High the finest athletic
field and gymnasium in the State.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally she had interested Mrs. Kerrick
in the girls of Central High, too, and reminded
the widowed lady that she was an alumna and
a member of the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. In her renewed interest
in the affairs of the secret society and in
the Girls’ Branch Athletic League, Mrs. Kerrick
had become very different from the almost helpless
invalid first introduced to the reader in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
first volume of this series, entitled “The Girls of
Central High; Or, Rivals for All Honors.”
</p>
<p>
In that first volume was related the establishment
of athletics for girls at Central High, and
introduced Laura Belding and her especial chums
in their school trials and triumphs. In the second
volume, “The Girls of Central High on
Lake Luna; Or, The Crew That Won,” were
narrated the summer aquatic sports of the same
group of girls and their boy friends.
</p>
<p>
“The Girls of Central High at Basketball; Or,
The Great Gymnasium Mystery,” the third volume
of the series, told of the girls when they had
become juniors and related the struggle of the
rival basketball teams of the three Centerport
highs, and the high schools of Keyport and
Lumberport, at either end of Lake Luna, for
the trophy cup. That series of games had just
been finished and Central High had won the
trophy, when Laura and her friends, as members
of the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R., are again introduced to the

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—WHAT JOSEPHINE MORSE NEEDED</h2>
<p>
In spite of the bright lights illuminating the
windows of the M. O. R. house—and many
other larger and finer houses at that end of
Whiffle Street—outside it was dark and dreary
enough. Especially was this so at the “poverty-stricken
end,” as Josephine Morse called her section
of the street. Jess and her widowed mother
lived on the fringe of the wealthy Hill district,
where Whiffle Street develops an elbow, suddenly
becomes narrow, and debouches upon Market
Street.
</p>
<p>
It was raining, too. Not an honest, splashing
downpour, but a drizzling, half-hearted rain
that drifted about the streets as though ashamed
of itself, leaving a deposit of slime on all the
crosswalks, and making the corner street-lamps
weep great tears. The gas-lamps, too, seemed
in a fog and struggled feebly against the blackness
of the evening.
</p>
<p>
Under a huge umbrella which snuffed her almost like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
a candle, Jess had made her way into
Market Street and to Mr. Closewick’s grocery
store near the corner. She carried a basket on
her arm and she had given the clerk rather a long
list of necessary things, although she had studied
to make the quantities as modest as possible.
The clerk had put them all up now and packed
them into the basket and stood expectantly with
the list checked off in his hand.
</p>
<p>
“Two dollars and seven cents, Miss Jess,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have to ask you to add that to our bill,”
said the girl, flushing. “Mother is short of
money just now.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait a moment, Miss Jess; I’ll speak to Mr.
Closewick,” said the clerk, seemingly as much
embarrassed as the girl herself, and he stepped
hastily toward the glass-enclosed office at the
rear of the store.
</p>
<p>
But the pursy old man with the double chin
and spectacles on his forehead, the height of
which the wisp of reddish-gray hair could not
hide, had observed it all. He got down ponderously
from his stool and squeaked out behind the
long counter in his shiny boots.
</p>
<p>
“I sent my bill over to your mother this morning,
Miss Jess,” he said. “It is more than
twenty dollars without this list of goods to-night,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
and he shook the modest little paper in
his hand, having taken it from the clerk.
</p>
<p>
“Mother is short of money just now,” repeated
Jess.
</p>
<p>
“So’m I. You tell her so. I can’t let you
increase your indebtedness,” and his pudgy hand
lifted the basket and put it on the shelf behind
him.
</p>
<p>
“You pay me something on account, or pay
for these goods you’ve ordered this evening.
I’m needing money, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Closewick! I hope you won’t do that,”
gasped Jess, paling under his stern glance. “We
will pay you—we always have. Mother sometimes
has to wait for her money—a long time.
We spend many a twenty-dollar bill in your
store during the year——”
</p>
<p>
“That ain’t neither here nor there,” said the
grocer, ponderously. “It’s a rule I have. Never
let a bill run more than twenty dollars. ’Specially
where there’s no man in the family. Hard to
collect from a woman. Makes me bad friends
if I press ’em. I can afford to risk losing twenty
dollars; but no more!”
</p>
<p>
“How can you!” cried Jess, under her breath,
for there was somebody else entering the store.
“We have bought of you for years——”
</p>
<p>
“And if I hadn’t stuck to the few business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
rules I have, I wouldn’t have been here selling
you goods for years,” returned Mr. Closewick,
grimly. “The sheriff would have sold me out.
I’m sorry for your mother, and I don’t want to
lose her trade. But business is business.”
</p>
<p>
“And you cannot favor us for this single occasion?”
choked Jess.
</p>
<p>
“It would lead to others; I can’t break a rule,”
said the grocer, stubbornly. “Come now, Miss
Jess! You go home and tell your mother how it
is. I’ll keep this basket right here for you, and
you come back with the two-seven, and it will be
all right.”
</p>
<p>
“That would be useless,” said Jess, clinging
to the counter for support, and feeling for the
moment as though she should sink, “We
haven’t any money—at present. If we had I
should not have asked you for any extension of
credit. Please give me back my basket.”
</p>
<p>
“So?” returned the grocer, frowning. “Very
well,” and he deliberately unpacked the parcels
and handed her the basket—making a show of so
doing in the presence of the newly arrived customer.
“And what can I do for <em>you</em>, this evening,
Mrs. Brown?” he asked, blandly, speaking
to the new arrival while he handed Jess her
basket without a word.
</p>
<p>
“And that woman will tell about it all over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
town!” thought the girl, as she hurried into the
street. “Oh, dear, dear! whatever shall I do?”
</p>
<p>
For the cupboard at the Morse cottage was
very bare indeed. Mrs. Mary Morse had some
little standing as a contributor to the more popular
magazines; but the returns from her pen-work
being her entire means of income, there
were sometimes weary waitings for checks. Jess
had been used to these unpleasant occasions ever
since she was a very little girl. Her mother was
of a nervous temperament and easily disturbed;
and as Jess had grown she had tried to shield her
mother, at these times of famine, from its most
unpleasant features.
</p>
<p>
As witness her passage-at-arms with the
grocer, Mr. Closewick. No money in the house,
an empty pantry, their credit cut off at the store
where they had always traded, and no credit established
at any other grocer’s shop! The situation
looked desperate, indeed, to Jess Morse.
</p>
<p>
Jess shrank from trying the butcher’s and the
dairy store, too. At each shop an unpaid bill
would stare her in the face and to-night she felt
as though each proprietor would demand a “payment
on account.” It was a black night indeed.
November was going out in its very mournfullest
and dismallest manner.
</p>
<p>
And for Jess Morse there was an added burden of disappointment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
and trouble. She was
not able to attend the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. reception, although
she was a member. Laura Belding, her
very dearest friend, would be there and would
wonder why she, Jess, did not appear. And
after the reception Chet Belding, Laura’s brother,
would be waiting to take Jess home—she hadn’t
had the heart to tell Chet that she would not
need his escort from the reception.
</p>
<p>
But, as Jess had told her mother, that blue
party dress had become impossible. Let alone
its being months behind the fashion, it was
frayed around the bottom and the front breadth
was sorely stained. And she hadn’t another
gown fit to put on in the evening. She did so
long for something to wear at a party in which
her friends would not know her two blocks away.
So she had “cut” the reception at the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.
house.
</p>
<p>
All this was a heavy load on Jess Morse’s
mind as she approached, with hesitating steps,
the butter and egg shop kept by Mr. Vandergriff.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” thought the troubled girl, “I
either need a whole lot of courage, or a lot of
money—either would come in very handy to-night.”
</p>
<p>
Just then Jess was aroused from her brown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
study by hearing somebody calling breathlessly
after her.
</p>
<p>
“Hi! Hi! Aren’t you going to look
around? Jess Morse!”
</p>
<p>
A girl smaller than herself, and dressed from
neck to heels in a glistening raincoat, ran under
Jess’s umbrella and seized her arm. She was a
laughing, curly-haired girl with dancing black
eyes and an altogether roguish look.
</p>
<p>
“Jess Morse! don’t you ever look back on the
street—no matter what happens?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“For what was Lot’s wife turned to salt,
Bobby?” returned Jess, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
“For good! Now you know, don’t you?”
laughed Clara Hargrew, whose youthful friends
knew her as “Bobby.”
</p>
<p>
“Why aren’t you at the ‘big doin’s’ to-night,”
demanded the harum-scarum Bobby. “You’re a
Mother of the Republic; what means this delinquency?”
</p>
<p>
“Just supposing I had something else to do?”
returned Jess, trying to speak lightly. “I’m on
an errand now.”
</p>
<p>
She wished to shake Bobby off. She dared
not take her into Mr. Vandergriff’s store. Suppose
the butter and egg man should treat her as
the grocer had?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say! you ought to be up there,” cried the
unconscious Bobby. “I just came past the
house and it was all lit up like—like a hotel.
And Mr. Sharp was just coming out with Mrs.
Kerrick. Mrs. Kerrick is going to do something
big for us girls of Central High.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Jess, only half
interested in Bobby’s gossip.
</p>
<p>
“Going to give us a chance to win a prize, or
something,” pursued Bobby.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! how do you know?” Jess showed more
interest now.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I heard Mr. Sharp say, as he was helping
Mrs. Kerrick into Colonel Swayne’s auto:
</p>
<p>
“‘The girls of Central High should be delighted,
Mrs. Kerrick—and very grateful to you,
indeed. Two hundred dollars! And a chance
for any smart girl to win it!’—just like that.
Now, Jess, you and I are both smart girls, aren’t
we?” demanded Bobby, roguishly.
</p>
<p>
“We think we are, at any rate,” returned Jess,
more eagerly. “Two hundred dollars! Oh!
wouldn’t that be fine!”
</p>
<p>
“It would buy a lot of candy and ice-cream
sodas,” chuckled Bobby.
</p>
<p>
But to herself Jess Morse thought: “And it
would mean the difference, for mother and me,
between penury and independence! Oh, dear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
me! is it something that I can do to earn two
hundred dollars?”
</p>
<p>
And she listened to Bobby’s surmises about
the mysterious prize without taking in half what
the younger girl was saying. Two hundred dollars!
And she and her mother did not have a
cent. She looked up and saw the lights of the
butter and egg store just ahead, and sighed.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—WHAT MR. CHUMLEY NEEDED</h2>
<p>
“Well, old Molly-grubs, I’ve got to leave
you here,” said Bobby Hargrew, pinching the
arm of Jess. “You’re certainly down in the
mouth to-night. I never saw you so before. I’d
like to know what the matter is with you,” complained
Bobby, and ran off in the rain.
</p>
<p>
Jess was heartily glad to get rid of her; and it
was seldom that she ever felt that way about
Bobby. Bobby was the double distilled essence
of cheerfulness.
</p>
<p>
But Jess felt as though nothing could cheer
her to-night but the finding of a big, fat pocket-book
on the street—one that “didn’t belong to
nobody!” There wasn’t such an object in sight,
however, along the glistening walk—the walk
that glistened in the lamplight from Mr. Vandergriff’s
store.
</p>
<p>
She positively <em>had</em> to try her luck at the butter
and egg shop. The man could do no more than
refuse her, that was sure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
But when Jess had lowered her umbrella and
backed into the shop, she found several customers
waiting at the counter. Mr. Vandergriff
and his son, whom the boys called “Griff”
and who played fullback on the Central High
football team, were waiting upon these customers.
Soon Griff was through with the man he
was waiting on and came to Jess.
</p>
<p>
“What’s yours to-night, Miss Morse?” he
asked, and was so cheerful about it that the girl’s
heart rose. They didn’t owe Mr. Vandergriff
such a large bill, anyway. The proprietor was
waiting upon the lady who stood beside Jess as
she gave her order to Griff. The lady was a
very dressy person and she laid her silver-mesh
purse on the counter between herself and Jess.
The latter saw the glint of gold coins between
the meshes of the purse and her heart throbbed.
She moved quietly away from the lady. Wasn’t
it wicked—seemingly—that one should have so
much money, while another needed the very necessities
of life?
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Griff,” Jess heard herself saying
to the younger Vandergriff, as he packed her
modest order in the basket. “I shall have to
ask you to charge that.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, Miss Morse. Nothing more to-night?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Jess, and went back and unhooked
her umbrella from the edge of the counter where
she had hung it, and started for the door. A
bright-eyed man in a long blue raincoat who had
been waited upon by Griff already was just then
going out, and he held open the door for her.
As she stepped out the girl saw that the rain was
no longer falling—merely a mist clung about the
street lamps. She did not raise her umbrella,
but hurried toward home.
</p>
<p>
There was enough in her basket for breakfast,
at least. She would wait until to-morrow—which
was Saturday—before she went to the
butcher’s. Perhaps something would happen.
Perhaps in the morning mail there would be a
check for her mother instead of a returned manuscript.
</p>
<p>
And all the time, while her feet flew homeward,
she thought of the prize of two hundred
dollars that Mrs. Mabel Kerrick was to offer for
the girls of Central High to work for. What
was the task? Could it be something that <em>she</em>
excelled in?
</p>
<p>
Jess was almost tempted to wait up until the
reception was over and then run to the Belding
house and see her chum before Laura went to
bed. Laura might know all about it.
</p>
<p>
<em>Two hundred dollars!</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
Jess saw the words before her in dancing,
rain-drop letters. They seemed to beckon her
on, and in a few minutes she was at the cottage,
just at the “elbow” of Whiffle Street, and came
breathlessly into the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
The room was empty, and the fire in the stove
was but a spark. Jess tiptoed to the sitting-room
door and peered in. Her mother, wearing an
ink-stained jacket, was busy at her desk, the pen
scratching on the big sheets of pad paper. The
typewriter was open, too, and the girl could see
that the title and opening paragraphs of a new
story had already been written on the machine.
</p>
<p>
“Genius burns again!” sighed Jess, and went
back to remove her damp hat and jacket, and replenish
the fire. Mother would want some tea
by and by, if she worked late into the evening,
and Jess drew the kettle forward.
</p>
<p>
She stood her umbrella behind the entry door,
and removed her overshoes and put them under
the range to dry. She had scarcely done so
when a stumbling foot sounded on the porch.
She opened the door before the visitor could
knock, so that Mrs. Morse would not be disturbed.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mr. Chumley!” she exclaimed, recognizing
the withered little man who stood there.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! you’re home, are ye?” squeaked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
landlord. “I was here a little while ago and
nobody answered my knock, though I could hear
that typewriter going <em>rat, tat, tat</em> all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry, Mr. Chumley,” said Jess, hastily.
“But you know how mother is when she’s busy.
She hears nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you come in?” hesitated Jess, still
holding the door. The rent was not due for a
day or two, and he usually gave them a few days’
grace if they did not happen to have it right in
the nick of time.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I will,” squeaked the landlord.
</p>
<p>
He was a little whiffet of a man—“looked like
a figure on a New Year’s cake,” Bobby Hargrew
said. His mouth was a mere slit in his gray,
wrinkled face, and his eyes were so close together
that the sharp bridge of his nose scarcely parted
them.
</p>
<p>
Some landlords hire agents to attend to their
property and to the collection of rents. Not so
Mr. Chumley. He did not mind the trouble of
collecting, and he could fight off repairs longer
than any landlord in town. And the one-half of
one per cent. collection fee was an item.
</p>
<p>
“Think I’ve come ahead of time, eh?” he
cackled, rubbing his blue hands—as blue as a
turkey’s foot, Jess thought—over the renewed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
fire. “It ain’t many days before rent’s due
again. If ye have it handy ye can pay me now,
Miss Josephine.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t handy, Mr. Chumley. We are
shorter than usual just now,” said Jess, hating
the phrase that comes so often to the lips of poverty.
</p>
<p>
“Well! well! Can’t expect money before it’s
due, I s’pose,” said the old man, licking his thin
lips. “And I’m afraid ye find it pretty hard to
meet your bills at ’tis?” he added, his head on
one side like a gray old stork.
</p>
<p>
Jess flushed and then paled. What had <em>he</em>
heard? Had that Mrs. Brown, in the grocer’s
shop, told him already that Mr. Closewick had
refused to let her increase the bill? The girl
looked at him without speaking, schooling her
features to betray nothing of the fear that
gripped her heart.
</p>
<p>
“Hey?” squeaked Mr. Chumley. “Don’t ye
hear well?”
</p>
<p>
“I hear you, sir,” said Jess, glancing quickly
to make sure that she had closed the door tightly
between the kitchen and the room in which her
mother was at work.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m willin’ to help folks out—always,”
said Mr. Chumley, his withered cheek
flushing. “If you’re finding the rent of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
house too much fer ye, why, there’s cheaper tenements
in town. I own some of ’em myself.
Taxes is increased this year and I gotter go up
on all rentals——”
</p>
<p>
“But, Mr. Chumley! we’ve lived in this cottage
of yours ever since I can remember. We’ve
paid you a lot of rent. You surely are not going
to increase it now?”
</p>
<p>
“I am, after December, Miss Josephine,” declared
Mr. Chumley. “I gotter do it. Beginnin’
with January first your mother will have to
pay three dollars more each month. You kin tell
her that. I’m giving you a month’s warning.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Chumley! Surely you won’t put us
out——”
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t sayin’ nothing about putting you out,
though your mother ain’t as sure pay as some
others. She’s slow. And she’s a woman alone.
Hard to git your money out of a widder woman.
No. She can stay if she pays the three dollars
increase. Otherwise, I got the cottage as good
as rented right now to another party.”
</p>
<p>
He moved toward the door, without lifting his
eyes again to Jess’s face.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll tell her that,” he said. “I’d like to
do business with her instead of with a half-grown
gal. Don’t suppose you <em>could</em> let me have the
next month’s rent to-night, eh?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t due yet, Mr. Chumley,” Jess said,
undecided whether to “get mad” or to cry!
</p>
<p>
“Well——Hello! who’s these?”
</p>
<p>
There was another clatter of footsteps upon
the porch as old Mr. Chumley opened the outer
door. Jess looked past him and saw a female
and a male figure crowding into the entry. For
a moment she recognized neither.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the girl!” exclaimed the woman, and
her voice was sharp and excited.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” muttered Mr. Chumley, and stood
aside. “Here’s young Vandergriff.”
</p>
<p>
Jess looked on, speechless with amazement.
She now recognized Griff, and the woman with
him was the fashionably attired lady who had
stood beside Jess at the counter in the butter
and egg store.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Jess! Miss Jess!” exclaimed Griff,
quickly. “Did you open your umbrella on the
way home?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I——”
</p>
<p>
“Stupid!” exclaimed the woman.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Griff, I didn’t open it.”
</p>
<p>
“And you haven’t opened it yet?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—no,” admitted the puzzled Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Where is it?” cried the young man. “Now,
you wait, Mrs. Prentice. I know it will be all
right.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s all very fine, young man. But it isn’t
your purse that is lost,” exclaimed the woman,
tartly.
</p>
<p>
At last Jess understood. She started forward
and her face flamed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she cried. “Did you lose that silver
mesh purse?”
</p>
<p>
“You see! She remembers it well enough,”
said the woman.
</p>
<p>
“I could scarcely forget it. You laid it on the
counter between us. And it was heavy with
money,” said Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Now, wait!” cried Griff, interposing, while
old Chumley listened eagerly, his little eyes snapping.
“Did you set your umbrella aside without
opening it, Miss Morse?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I did,” repeated Jess.
</p>
<p>
“And you had it hanging by the hooked handle
on the edge of the counter right beside this lady,
didn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I did.”
</p>
<p>
“I saw it. It’s just like a story book!”
laughed Griff. “Get the umbrella, Miss Morse.
I knew it would be all right——”
</p>
<p>
“I am not convinced that it is ‘all right,’ as
you say, young man,” spoke Mrs. Prentice, eyeing
Jess’s flushed face, suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“Get it from behind the door there, Griff,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
said the girl, hurriedly. She, too, had heard of
such an incident as this. Perhaps the purse had
been knocked from the counter into her open
umbrella. But suppose it was <em>not</em> there?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—WHAT MRS. PRENTICE NEEDED</h2>
<p>
“Here it is! here’s the umbrella!” squeaked
the officious Mr. Chumley, coming out from behind
the entry door, where he had been listening.
</p>
<p>
All three of them—Jess, Griff, and the excited
loser of the purse—reached for the umbrella; but
Griff was the first.
</p>
<p>
“Hold on!” said he to the landlord. “Let
me have that, sir. The purse was lost in our
store. We’re just as much interested in the matter
as anybody.”
</p>
<p>
“I fail to see that, young man,” said Mrs.
Prentice, tartly.
</p>
<p>
She was not naturally of a mean disposition;
but she was excited, and the explanation Griff
had given her of the loss of the purse had seemed
to her unimaginative mind “far-fetched,” to say
the least.
</p>
<p>
The boy half opened the umbrella and turned
it over. Crash to the floor fell the purse, and
it snapped open as it landed. Out upon the linoleum
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
rolled the glistening coins—several of them
gold pieces—that Jess had noted so greedily in
the egg store.
</p>
<p>
“What did I tell you?” cried Griff, looking
at Mrs. Prentice.
</p>
<p>
That lady only exclaimed “Oh!” very loudly
and looked aghast at the rolling coins. Jess half
stooped to gather up the scattered money. Then
she thought better of it and straightened up,
looking straight into the face of the owner of
the purse.
</p>
<p>
But old Mr. Chumley could not stand the lack
of interest the others seemed to show in what—to
him—was the phase of particular importance
in the whole affair. There was real money rolling
all over the Widow Morse’s kitchen. He
went down on his rheumatic old knees and
scrambled for it. Mr. Chumley worshipped
money, anyway, and this was a worshipper’s
rightful attitude.
</p>
<p>
“My, my, my!” he kept repeating. “How
careless!”
</p>
<p>
But Mrs. Prentice’s expression of countenance
was swiftly changing. She flushed deeply—much
more deeply than had Jess; then she paled.
She picked up Mr. Chumley’s phrase, although
she allowed the old man to pick up the money.
</p>
<p>
“I certainly <em>have</em> been careless,” she said. “I—I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
have nudged that purse off the counter
with my elbow. I—I——My dear girl! will you
forgive me?”
</p>
<p>
She stepped forward and opened her arms to
Jess. She was not only a well dressed lady, but
she was a handsome one, and her smile, when she
chose to allow it to appear, was winning. The
anger and indignation Jess had felt began to melt
before this apology and the lady’s frank manner.
</p>
<p>
“I—I suppose it was a natural mistake,”
stammered Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Not if she’d known you, Miss Jess,” Griff
said, quite sharply for him. “Nobody who knew
you or your mother would have accused you of
taking a penny’s worth that didn’t rightfully belong
to you.”
</p>
<p>
Jess, whose heart was still sore from the blow
she had received at Mr. Closewick’s grocery,
thought this was very kind of Griff. And they
owed his father, too! If there were tears standing
in her eyes they were tears of gratitude.
</p>
<p>
“You see, my dear,” said the lady, her voice
very pleasant indeed now, “I did not know you
as well as young Mr. Vandergriff seems to.”
</p>
<p>
“We—we go to school together,” explained
Jess, weakly, and found herself drawn into the
arms of the lady.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Chumley rose up with a grunt and a
groan; he had the purse and all the coins.
</p>
<p>
“Very careless! very careless!” he repeated.
“And here is nearly a hundred dollars, madam.
Think of carelessly carrying a hundred dollars in
a silly purse like that! It is astonishing——”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Prentice had implanted a soft little kiss
on Jess’s forehead and shaken her a little playfully
by both shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you bear malice, my dear,” she whispered.
Then she turned briefly to the old man.
</p>
<p>
“You’re very kind, I’m sure,” she said, taking
the purse into which Mr. Chumley had crammed
the money. “Thank you.”
</p>
<p>
“Money comes too hard for folks to scatter
it around,” complained the landlord.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Prentice seemed to be much amused. “I
should be more careful, I suppose. I presume,
now, I ought to count it to see if—if you gathered
it all up, sir?” she added, her eyes dancing.
</p>
<p>
A little breath of red crept into the withered
cheeks of the miserly old man. “Well, well!”
he ejaculated. “One can’t be too careful.”
</p>
<p>
“I presume not,” said the lady.
</p>
<p>
“And if the gal had known the money was
there she might have been tempted, ye see.”
</p>
<p>
Jess flushed again and Griff looked angry; but
Mrs. Prentice said, coolly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
“Were <em>you</em> tempted, sir? Perhaps I had better
count my money, after all?”
</p>
<p>
“Ahem! ahem!” coughed the old gentleman.
“Perhaps you don’t know who I am? There is
a vast difference between me—my condition, I
mean—and the gal and her mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! Do you think so?” asked Mrs. Prentice,
and then turned her back upon him. “I
should like to know you better, my dear—and
your mother. I hope you will show me that I
am really forgiven by allowing me to call some
day——Oh! I couldn’t face your mother now. I
know just how I would feel myself if I had a
daughter who had been accused as I accused you.
I certainly need to take care—as our friend here
says.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure mother would be pleased to meet
you,” stammered Jess.
</p>
<p>
“You know, I am Mrs. Prentice. My
brother-in-law, Patrick Sarsfield Prentice, is editor
and proprietor of the Centerport <em>Courier</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Jess’s interest was doubly aroused now. So
<em>this</em> was the rich Mrs. Prentice, whom they said
really backed Centerport’s newest venture in the
newspaper field?
</p>
<p>
“My mother has met Mr. Prentice—your
brother-in-law,” she said, diffidently. “You
know, mother writes. She is Mary Morse.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yes,” said the lady, preparing to follow
Griff out. “I am really glad to have known you—but
I am sorry we began our acquaintance so
unfortunately.”
</p>
<p>
“That—that is all right, Mrs. Prentice,” returned
the girl.
</p>
<p>
Griff called back goodnight to her over his
shoulder. And at the gate he parted from the
lady whose carelessness had made all the trouble.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what I told you, Mrs. Prentice,”
he said. “They’re all right folks, those Morses.
Yes, Mrs. Prentice, I’ll remember to send all
those things you ordered over in the morning—first
delivery,” and he went off, whistling.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—THERE IS A GENERAL NEED</h2>
<p>
Mrs Prentice would have turned away from
the gate of the Morse cottage and gone her homeward
way, too, had she not heard a cackling little
“ahem!” behind her. There was the wizened
Mr. Chumley right on her heels.
</p>
<p>
“Very fortunate escape—very fortunate escape,
indeed,” said the landlord.
</p>
<p>
“It was,” agreed the repentant lady. “I
might have gone farther and done much worse in
my excitement.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” said he. “I mean it was fortunate
for the girl—and her mother. Of course,
they’ve got nothing, and had the money really
been missing it would have looked bad.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Prentice eyed him in a way that would
have made a person with a thinner skin writhe a
little. But Mr. Chumley’s feelings were not
easily hurt.
</p>
<p>
“You evidently know all about those people?”
said the lady, brusquely.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. They’ve been my tenants for some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
years. But rents are going up in this neighborhood
and——Well, I can get a much more satisfactory
tenant.”
</p>
<p>
“You have been warning them out of the cottage?”
asked Mrs. Prentice, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Not just that,” said the old man, rubbing his
hands together as though he had an imaginary
cake of soap between them and was busily washing
the Morse affair from his palms. “You see,
I’ve told them I shall be obliged to increase their
rent at New Year’s.”
</p>
<p>
“What do they pay you now?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Chumley told her frankly. He wasn’t
ashamed of what he took for the renting of that
particular piece of property. In a business way,
he was doing very well, and business was all that
mattered with Mr. Chumley.
</p>
<p>
“But that’s better than <em>I</em> can get for the same
sort of a cottage in this very vicinity,” exclaimed
Mrs. Prentice.
</p>
<p>
“Ah! these agents!” groaned Mr. Chumley,
shaking his head. “They never will do as well
as they should for an owner. I found that out
long ago. If I was a younger man, Mrs. Prentice,
I would take hold of your property and get
you twenty-five per cent. more out of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” commented the lady. “And you
intend to raise the rent on these people?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have done so. Three dollars. I can get
it. Besides, a woman alone ain’t good pay,” said
Chumley. “And they’re likely to fall behind
any time in the rent. Most uncertain income——”
</p>
<p>
“Is it true that Mrs. Morse writes for a living?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what sort of a livin’ she makes.
Foolish business. She’d better take in washing,
or go out to day’s work—that’s what she’d better
do,” snarled the old man. “This messin’ with
pen, ink, an’ a typewriter an’ thinkin’ she can
buy pork an’ pertaters on the proceeds——”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps she doesn’t care for pork and potatoes,
my friend,” laughed the lady, eyeing Mr.
Chumley whimsically.
</p>
<p>
But a flush had crept into the old man’s withered
cheek again. He was on his hobby and he
rode it hard.
</p>
<p>
“Poor folks ain’t no business to have finicky
idees, or tastes,” he declared. “They gotter
work. That’s what they was put in the world
for—to work. There’s too many of ’em trying
to keep their hands clean, an’ livin’ above their
means. Mary Morse is a good, strong, hearty
woman. She’d ought to do something useful
with her hands instead of doing silly things with
her mind.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“So she writes silly things?”
</p>
<p>
“Stories! Not a word of truth in ’em, I
vum! I read one of ’em once,” declared Mr.
Chumley. “Widder Morse wants to ape these
well-to-do folks that live ’tother end o’ Whiffle
Street. Keeps her gal in high school when she’d
ought to be in a store or a factory, earnin’ her
keep. She’s big enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think that’s a good way to bring up
girls—letting them go to work so early in life?”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked the old man, in wonder.
“They kin work cheap and it helps trade. Too
much schoolin’ is bad for gals. They don’t need
it, anyway. And all the fal-lals and di-does they
l’arn ’em in high school now doesn’t amount to
a row of pins in practical life. No, ma’am!”
</p>
<p>
“But do these Morses have such a hard time
getting along?” asked Mrs. Prentice, trying to
bring the gossipy old gentleman back to the main
subject.
</p>
<p>
“They don’t meet their bills prompt,” snapped
the landlord. “Now! here I was in the house
to-night. I suggested that the gal pay the rent
for December; it’ll be due in a day or two. And
she didn’t have it. They’re often late with it.
I have to come two or three times before I get
it, some months. And I hear they owe the
tradesmen a good deal.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“They are really in need of sympathy and
help, then?”
</p>
<p>
“How’s that?” demanded Mr. Chumley, with
his cupped hand to his ear as though he could
not believe his own hearing.
</p>
<p>
The lady repeated her remark.
</p>
<p>
“There you go! You’re another of them folks
that waste their substance. I could see that by
your keerless handlin’ of money,” croaked Mr.
Chumley. “The Widder Morse don’t need help—she
needs sense, I tell ye.”
</p>
<p>
“And do you know what you need, Mr. Chumley?”
asked the lady, suddenly, and with some
asperity.
</p>
<p>
“Heh?”
</p>
<p>
“You need charity! We all need it. And
we’ve gossiped enough about our neighbors, I
declare! Good night, Mr. Chumley,” she added,
and turned off through the side street toward
her own home, leaving the old man to wend his
own way homeward, wagging his head and muttering
discourteous comments upon “all fool
women.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Prentice was a widow herself. But she
had no mawkish sentimentality. She had lived
in the world too many years for that. She was
not given to charities of any kind. But the
thought of Jess Morse and her widowed mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
clung to her mind like a limpet to a rock—even
after she had dismissed her maid that night and
retired.
</p>
<p>
“Just think!” she muttered, with her head on
the pillow. “If that purse had been really lost I
might have made that young girl a lot of trouble—and
her mother. And she is such a frank,
courageous little thing!
</p>
<p>
“We <em>do</em> need more charity—the right kind.
Somehow—yes—I <em>must</em> do something to help
that girl.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—IT ALL COMES OUT</h2>
<p>
Before morning old Jack Frost snapped his
fingers and the whole world was encased in ice.
The sidewalks were a glare, the trees, and bushes,
to their tiniest twig, were as brittle as icicles, and
a thin white blanket had been laid upon the lawns
along Whiffle Street.
</p>
<p>
It was the first really cold snap of winter.
Chet Belding came clumping down to breakfast
that Saturday morning.
</p>
<p>
“Skating shoes!” exclaimed his sister, Laura.
“What for, Sir Knight?”
</p>
<p>
“I bet a feller can skate in the street—on the
sidewalk—almost anywhere this morning,” declared
Chet, with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean to try it?” cried Laura.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll eat my honorable grandmother’s hat if I
don’t——”
</p>
<p>
“Chetwood!”
</p>
<p>
The horrified ejaculation came from behind
the coffee percolator. Mrs. Belding had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
perusing her morning mail. Mr. Chetwood
chuckled, but graduated it into a pronounced
cough.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am!” said Chet, meekly.
</p>
<p>
“What <em>kind</em> of language is this that you bring
to our table? Your grandmother certainly was
honorable——”
</p>
<p>
“That’s an imitation of the stilted expressions
of the Japs and Chinks,” interrupted Chetwood.
“Thought you’d like it. It’s formal, abounds in
flowery expressions, and may not be hastened.
Quotation from Old Dimple,” he added, sotto
voce.
</p>
<p>
“Please leave your grandmother out of it,”
said Mrs. Belding, severely. “And if you mean
Professor Dimp, your teacher at Central High,
do not call him ‘Old Dimple’ in my presence,”
which showed that Mother Belding’s hearing was
pretty acute.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” said Chet, “I’m going to try the
ice after breakfast. Going to get Lance and
we’ll have some fun. Better get your skates,
Laura.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I’m going to the store with father—if
we don’t both tumble down and roll to the bottom
of the hill at Market Street, like Jack and
Jill,” laughed his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Teams can’t get over the asphalt this morning,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
her brother. “We can coast clear to
the elbow, I bet you.”
</p>
<p>
He hurried through his breakfast and some
time after Laura and her father started for the
jewelry store, in which the girl had certain Saturday
morning tasks to perform, the voices of
Chet and his friends awoke the echoes of the
street as they skated on the asphalt.
</p>
<p>
Whiffle Street was an easy slope toward the
elbow, where Jess Morse and her mother lived.
Although the keen wind blew pretty strongly
right up the hill, when Laura and her father
started for the store the boys were holding hands
and in a line that swept the street from curb to
curb, sailed gaily down the hill upon their
skates.
</p>
<p>
“That’s fun!” exclaimed Laura, her cheeks
rosy with the wind, and her eyes sparkling.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just like life,” said her father, “It’s
easy going down hill; but see what a pull it is
to get up again,” for Chet and his comrades had
then begun the homeward skate.
</p>
<p>
Lance Darby, a fair-haired, rosy-cheeked lad,
who was Chet’s particular chum, was ahead
and he came, puffingly, to a stop just before
Laura.
</p>
<p>
“This is great—if it wasn’t for the ‘getting
back again.’ Good-morning, Mr. Belding.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you boys rig something to tow
you up the hill?” asked Laura, laughing, and
half hiding her face in her muff.
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” ejaculated her brother, coming up,
too. “How’d we rig it, Sis?”
</p>
<p>
“Come on, Mother Wit!” laughed Lance.
“You tell us.”
</p>
<p>
“Why—I declare, Chet’s got just the thing
standing behind the door in his den,” cried Laura,
her eyes twinkling.
</p>
<p>
“What?” cried Chet “You’re fooling us,
Laura. My snowshoes——”
</p>
<p>
“Not them,” laughed Laura, preparing to go
on with her father.
</p>
<p>
“I know!” shouted Lance, slapping his chum
suddenly on the back. He was as familiar with
Chet’s room as was Chet himself.
</p>
<p>
“Out with it, then!” demanded Chet.
</p>
<p>
“That big kite of yours. Wind’s directly up
the hill. We’ll get it and try the scheme. Oh,
you Mother Wit!” shouted Lance, after Laura.
“We’re going after the kite.”
</p>
<p>
And that suggestion of Laura’s was the beginning
of Chet and Lance Darby’s “mile-a-minute
iceboat”—but more of that wonderful
invention later.
</p>
<p>
Laura was halted again before she reached
Market Street, and her father went on without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
her, for it was now half-past eight. Jess Morse
waved to her from a window, and in a moment
came running out in a voluminous checked apron
and a gay sweater-coat, hastily “shrugged”
on.
</p>
<p>
“Where were you last night?” cried Laura.
“We missed you dreadfully at the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.
house.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I really couldn’t come,” said her chum,
hesitating just a little, for it was hard not to
be perfectly frank with Laura, who was always
so open and confidential with <em>her</em>. “Mother is
so busy—she worked half the night——”
</p>
<p>
“Genius burns the midnight oil, eh?” laughed
Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed. And now I’m about to make
her toast and brew her tea, and she will take it,
propped up in bed, and read over the work she
did last night. Saturdays, when I am home, is
mother’s ‘lazy day.’ She says she feels quite
like a lady of leisure then.”
</p>
<p>
“But you should have come to the first big
reception of the winter,” complained her chum.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t. But I heard that there was something
very wonderful going to happen, just the
same,” cried Jess.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“About the prize.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! Somebody is a telltale,”
cried Laura, laughing. “We were not going to
spread the news until Monday morning.”
</p>
<p>
Jess told her how the rumor of the prize had
come to her ears.
</p>
<p>
“No use—it’s all out, and all over town, if
Bobby Hargrew got hold of it.”
</p>
<p>
“But what’s Mrs. Mabel Kerrick going to give
the two hundred dollars <em>for?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Jess! it’s a great scheme, I believe—and
it’s mine,” said Laura, proudly.
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t tell me <em>what</em> it is,” cried her
chum, impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“It’s to be given for the best play written by
a Central High girl, between now and the first
of January. Any girl can compete—even the
freshies. And then we’ll produce it, and get
money for the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. building fund.”
</p>
<p>
“A play!” gasped Jess, her face flushing.
</p>
<p>
“That’s it. And the Lockwood girls are going
to try for it—and so’s Nell Agnew. Will
you, Jess? Just think of two hundred dollars!”
</p>
<p>
“I am thinking of it,” replied her chum. “Oh,
Laura! I’m thinking of it all the time.”
</p>
<p>
She said it so earnestly that Laura stared at
her in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“My dear child!” she cried. “Does two hundred
dollars mean so much to you?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—I can’t tell you how <em>hard</em> I want to win
it,” gasped Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Well! I’m going to try for it, too,” laughed
Laura, suddenly, seizing her friend’s arm and
giving it an affectionate squeeze. “But I <em>do</em>
hope, if I can’t win it, that you do!”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Laura!” replied her friend,
gravely.
</p>
<p>
“And your mother’s a writer—you must have
talent, too, for writing, Jess.”
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t follow, I guess,” laughed Jess.
“You know that Si Jones talks like a streak of
greased lightning—so Chet says, anyway—but
his son, Phil, is a deaf-mute. Talent for writing
runs in families the same as wooden legs.”
</p>
<p>
“So you do not believe that even a little reflected
glory bathes your path through life?”
chuckled Laura.
</p>
<p>
“I am not sure that I would want to be a
professional writer like mother,” sighed Jess, her
mind dwelling on the trouble they were in.
“There is a whole lot to it besides ‘glory.’”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if I can’t write the winning play, I
hope you do, Jess,” repeated Laura, going on
after her father.
</p>
<p>
Jess returned to her work indoors. From the
window, after a little, she caught sight of a
whole string of boys sliding up the hill of Whiffle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
Street on their skates, the big kite which Chet
and Lance had raised supplying the motive
power.
</p>
<p>
Chet beckoned her out to have a part in the
fun; but much more serious matters filled Jess
Morse’s mind. When her mother finally arose,
and folded and sealed and addressed the packet
containing her night’s work, Jess had to go out
and mail it.
</p>
<p>
“I really believe that is a good story, Jess,”
said her mother, who was sanguine of temperament.
She had a childish faith in the success
of every manuscript she sent out; and usually
when her chickens “came home to roost” her
spirits withstood the shock admirably.
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t forget the list of things you were
to get at Mr. Closewick’s,” added Mrs. Morse.
Jess had kept her evening’s troubles strictly to
herself. “I believe he sent in a bill, but you
tell him how it is; we’ll have money in a day
or two.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Mother, we owe other stores, too,”
murmured Jess.
</p>
<p>
“I know it, child. But don’t remind me——”
</p>
<p>
“And the rent will be due. Mr. Chumley was
here last night——”
</p>
<p>
“Not for his rent so soon?” cried the irresponsible
lady.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
“But he is going to raise our rent—three dollars
more after January first.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how mean of him!” exclaimed Mrs.
Morse.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how we are going to get it,
Mother,” said Jess, worriedly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s true. But we’ve got another
month before we need to cross <em>that</em> bridge.”
</p>
<p>
That was Mrs. Morse’s way. Perhaps it was
as well that she allowed such responsibilities to
slip past her like water running off the feathers
of a duck.
</p>
<p>
“And if Mr. Closewick shouldn’t want to—to
trust us any longer, Mother?” suggested Jess.
That was as near as she could get to telling the
good lady what had really happened the night
before.
</p>
<p>
“Why! that would be most mortifying. He
won’t do it, though. But if he does, we’ll immediately
begin trading elsewhere, I don’t really
think Mr. Closewick always gives us good
weight, at that!”
</p>
<p>
Jess could only sigh. It was always the way.
Mrs. Morse saw things from a most surprising
angle. She was just as honest—intentionally—as
she could be, but the ethics of business dealing
were not quite straight in her mind.
</p>
<p>
And something must be done this very day to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
put food in the larder. What little Jess had
brought in from Mr. Vandergriff’s store would
not last them over Sunday. And her mother
seemed to think that everybody else would be
just as sanguine of her getting a check as she
was herself.
</p>
<p>
“I do wish you had been able to get steady
work with the <em>Courier</em>,” spoke Jess, as she prepared
to go out.
</p>
<p>
“That would have been nice,” admitted her
mother. “And I am in a position to know a
good deal of what goes on socially on the Hill.
I am welcome in the homes of the very best people,
for your father’s sake, Jess. He was a very
fine man, indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“And for your own sake, too, Mamma!”
cried Jess, who was really, after all, very proud
of her mother’s talent.
</p>
<p>
“It would have been nice,” repeated Mrs.
Morse. “And certainly the <em>Courier</em> is not covering
the Hill as well as might be. I pointed
that out to Mr. Prentice; but he is limited in
expenditures, I suppose, the paper being a new
venture.”
</p>
<p>
It was on the tip of the girl’s tongue to tell
her mother of the visit of Mr. Prentice’s sister-in-law
the evening before. But why disturb her
mother’s mind with all that trouble? So she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
said nothing, kissed her fondly, and sallied forth
to beard in their lairs “the butcher, the baker,
and the candlestick maker.” And, truly, there
were few girls in Centerport that day with
greater lions in their way than those in the path
of Jess Morse.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—THE HAND HELD OUT</h2>
<p>
When Jess came out of the house there was
a group of her schoolmates—and not all of them
boys—at the foot of the Whiffle Street hill. Being
towed by Chet’s big kite had became a game
that all hands wanted to try. But the sun was
getting warmer and the icy street would soon be
slushy and the skates would cut through.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve had enough,” said Bobby Hargrew, removing
her skates when she spied Jess. “The
policeman has warned us once, and he’ll be mad
next time he comes around if we’re here still.”
</p>
<p>
“Better get your skates, Jess, and try it just
once,” urged Chet Belding, who was very partial
to his sister’s closet chum.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t, Chet,” replied Jess. “I must do
my Saturday’s marketing.”
</p>
<p>
“Hullo! here’s Short and Long!” cried
Bobby, as a very short boy with very brisk legs
came sliding down the hill with a big bundle under
his arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
Billy Long was an industrious youngster who
only allowed himself leisure to keep up in athletics
after school hours, because he liked to earn
something toward his family’s support.
</p>
<p>
“Stop and try a ride, Billy,” urged Lance
Darby, holding the cord of the tugging kite.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t. Going on an errand.”
</p>
<p>
“Hey, Billy! how’s your dyspepsia?” demanded
another of the boys.
</p>
<p>
Billy grinned. Bobby exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t tell me that Short and Long ever
has trouble with his digestion—I won’t believe
it!”
</p>
<p>
“He sure had a bad case of it yesterday,”
drawled Chet Belding. “At least, so Mr. Sharp
said. Billy spelled it with an ‘i’.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me use your knife a minute, please?”
asked Bobby, who was still struggling with a
refractory strap. “No! just toss it to me.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right,” returned the small boy,
with a grin, as he walked over and carefully
handed Bobby the knife. “I don’t take any
chances with girls in throwing, or catching. All
my sister can do is to throw a fit, or catch a
cold!”
</p>
<p>
“Ow! isn’t that a wicked statement?” cried
Bobby. “You know it isn’t so. But you’re
right down ignorant, Billy. You’re just as bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
as Postscript was in Gee Gee’s class one day this
week.”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s ‘Postscript’?” demanded Lance.
“That’s a new one on me.”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said Bobby, her black eyes twinkling,
“I mean Adeline Moore. <em>That’s</em> a postscript,
isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“What happened to Addie?” asked Jess, as
the others laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Why, she got befuddled in reciting something
about an Indian uprising that came in our
American History hour. It’s all review stuff,
you know.
</p>
<p>
“‘What is it that you call an Indian woman,
Adeline?’ Gee Gee asked, real sharp.
</p>
<p>
“And Addie jumped, and stammered, and finally
said:
</p>
<p>
“‘A squaw, please, Miss Carrington.’
</p>
<p>
“‘And what do you call her baby, then?’
snapped Gee Gee.
</p>
<p>
“‘A—a squawker,’ says Addie, and the poor
thing got a black mark for it. Wasn’t that
mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Grace G. Carrington was in one of her
moods,” observed Chet, when the laugh had subsided.
</p>
<p>
“She’s subject to moods,” Lance drawled.
</p>
<p>
“No, she’s not!” cried Bobby Hargrew.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
“She only had one mood—the imperative—and
we girls are all subject to that,” and she sighed,
for Bobby was frequently in trouble with the
very strict assistant principal of Central High
whom she disrespectfully referred to as “Gee
Gee.”
</p>
<p>
Jess and her friend had left the others now
and were approaching Market Street. Like
everybody else on the walks, they had to be careful
how they stepped, and it was with many a
laugh and gibe that Bobby Hargrew beguiled
the way. Jess, however, was serious once more.
</p>
<p>
“Are you really going in for that prize Mrs.
Kerrick is going to put up for us?” demanded
Bobby.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know what it’s for?”
</p>
<p>
“No—I haven’t heard that,” said the younger
girl. “But for two hundred dollars I’d learn
tatting—or darn socks. Daddy says I ought to
learn to darn his. What’s it all about, anyway?
I suppose Laura knows?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. It’s a play. The girl who writes the
best one, that can be acted by us boys and girls
of Central High, is to get the prize.”
</p>
<p>
“Gee! won’t that be nuts for Miss Gould?”
cried Bobby. “You know, she tried us out in
blank verse the other day, and I made a hit.
My stately lines were spoken of with commendation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
And when she told us to bring in a
rhyme, or poetry—whichever we had the courage
to call it—I wanted to read mine out loud.
But she wouldn’t let me. She said she had not
intended to start a school for humorous poets.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you hand in?” asked Jess, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Want to hear it?” cried Bobby, eagerly, digging
into her pocket which—like a boy’s—was
always filled with a conglomeration of articles.
“Listen here!” she added, drawing forth a
crumpled paper. “This is called ‘Such is Life’
and really, I was hurt that Miss Gould considered
it so lightly,” and she began to read at once:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘William&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;often&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;bad;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffith&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiley,&nbsp;&nbsp;odd&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;state,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was&nbsp;&nbsp;almost&nbsp;&nbsp;always&nbsp;&nbsp;sad.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jedediah&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;very&nbsp;&nbsp;poor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozias&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;rich,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliphalet&nbsp;&nbsp;Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;Carpenter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earned&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;living&nbsp;&nbsp;digging&nbsp;&nbsp;ditch.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;White&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;black&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim&nbsp;&nbsp;Black&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;Jose&nbsp;&nbsp;Manuel&nbsp;&nbsp;Green&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;brown;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While&nbsp;&nbsp;Ching&nbsp;&nbsp;Ling&nbsp;&nbsp;Blu&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;yellow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;known&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;over&nbsp;&nbsp;town!’<br />
</p>
<p>
“I’d have made more of it,” added Bobby, “only
Miss Gould didn’t seem to care for that kind of
poetry. And I suppose if I tried my hand at a
play that I would be unable to hit the popular
taste,” and she sighed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess they won’t demand verse from us
in this play,” giggled Jess. “And that is most
atrocious, Bobby.”
</p>
<p>
“Think so?” returned her friend, her eyes
twinkling. “And you’ll do a whole lot better
when it comes to writing your own play, I
s’pose?”
</p>
<p>
“It won’t be in verse—blank, or otherwise,”
admitted Jess.
</p>
<p>
“You really <em>are</em> going to try for it?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Bobby, I’d love to win that two hundred
dollars. I don’t suppose I can. All the
girls will try, I expect, and Laura, or Nell Agnew,
will get it. But I want that two hundred
dollars worse than I ever wanted anything in my
life!”
</p>
<p>
She spoke so earnestly that Bobby was impressed.
The latter glanced at her sidewise and
a shrewd little smile hovered about her lips for a
moment, which Jess did not observe.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you bound for, Jess?” she asked
abruptly.
</p>
<p>
“Marketing.”
</p>
<p>
“You trade at Heuffler’s market, don’t you?
That’s right around the corner from father’s
store. Why don’t you ever patronize <em>our</em> place
for groceries. I’m drumming up trade,” said
Bobby, grinning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess our trade wouldn’t amount to much,”
said Jess, flushing a little.
</p>
<p>
“‘Every little bit added to what you’ve got
makes just a little bit more,’” quoted Bobby.
“And let me tell you, Mr. Thomas Hargrew
keeps first-class goods and only asks a fair
profit.”
</p>
<p>
Jess laughed; but she caught at the straw held
out to her, too. She knew it would be useless
to go to Mr. Closewick’s, where they usually
traded. Was it honest to try and obtain credit
at another grocery?
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid your father wouldn’t welcome
me as a customer,” said Jess, gravely. “Ours
isn’t always a cash trade. Mother’s money
comes so very irregular that we have to run a
bill at the grocery and the market and other
places.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on and give us a sample order,” urged
Bobby. “Father will be glad to get another
book account. Now, if <em>you</em> were running a
store I’d patronize it! We Central High girls
ought to work together—just like a lodge. Come
on.”
</p>
<p>
She fairly dragged Jess by the hand into the
store on Market Street, over the door of which
Mr. Hargrew’s name was displayed. The clerks
were busy at the moment, but Mr. Hargrew was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
at his desk in the corner. Bobby ran to him and
whispered quickly:
</p>
<p>
“Here she is, Father. You remember what
that Mrs. Brown said last night about old Closewick
refusing her credit after her mother had
traded there so long. And I am sure Jess is in
trouble and needs help. Do wait on her,
Father.”
</p>
<p>
“If you say so, Bob,” returned the big man,
smiling down upon the girl who, he often said,
“was as good as any boy.” “You’ll have to
come into this store and share the business when
you get older; and you might as well learn to
judge customers now. And, if they <em>need</em>
help——”
</p>
<p>
He came out to Jess Morse immediately, smiling
and bowing like the suave storekeeper he
was.
</p>
<p>
“Glad to see you, Miss, What can we do
for you this morning?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—why,” stammered Jess, “Bobby
urged me to come in; but, really, Mr. Hargrew,
it seems like asking a big favor of you, for we
have never traded here much.”
</p>
<p>
“We are always glad to make a new connection,”
said the storekeeper,
</p>
<p>
“But mother—we are obliged to ask for
credit——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“And that is what I have to do very frequently
myself,” interposed Mr. Hargrew, still
smiling. “What is it you wish, Miss Morse?
Your credit is good here, I assure you. You
have brought the very best of references—my
daughter’s. Now, what is the first article?”
</p>
<p>
Jess could have cried with relief! Somehow
she felt that Bobby and her father must know of
her need, yet not a word or sign from either
betrayed that fact. And one would scarcely suspect
harum-scarum Bobby Hargrew of engineering
such a delicate bit of business.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Jess was vastly encouraged by
this incident. She went into the meat shop and
purchased a small piece of lamb for over Sunday
and Mr. Heuffler did not ask her for his bill.
She hoped that “something would turn up” and
watched the mails very eagerly, hoping that a
fugitive check might come. But the postman
never came near the little cottage at the elbow
in Whiffle Street, all that day.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—THE RACE IS ON</h2>
<p>
There was a rustle of expectancy—upon the
girls’ side, at least—at Assembly on Monday
morning. Rumors of the prize offered for the
best play written by a girl of Central High had
aroused great interest and the school eagerly
awaited Mr. Sharp’s brief remarks regarding it.
</p>
<p>
“It is not our wish,” said the principal, in the
course of his speech, “to restrict the contestants
in their choice of subjects, or in methods of
treatment. The play may be pure comedy,
comedy-drama, tragedy—even farce—or melodrama.
Miss Gould will confine her lectures
this week in English to the discussion of plays
and play-making. Candidates for fame—and
for Mrs. Kerrick’s very handsome prize—may
learn much if they will faithfully attend Miss
Gould’s classes. And, of course, it is understood
that there must be no neglect of the regular
school work by those striving for the laurel
of the playwright.
</p>
<p>
“I doubt if we have any budding female
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
Shakespeares among us, yet I realize that the
youthful mind naturally slants towards tragedy
and the redundant phrases of the Greek and
Latin masters, as read in their translation; but
let me advise all you young ladies who wish to
compete for the prize, to select a simple subject
and treat it simply.
</p>
<p>
“Have your play display human nature as you
know it, and realism without morbidness.”
</p>
<p>
The girls of Central High who had heretofore
excelled in composition naturally were looked
upon as favorites in this race for dramatic honors.
Among the Juniors, Laura Belding and
Nellie Agnew always received high marks for
such work. They possessed the knack of composition
and were what Bobby Hargrew called
“fluid writers.”
</p>
<p>
“If it was a jingle or limerick, I’d stand a
chance,” sighed Bobby to herself. “But think
of the sustained effort of writing a whole play!
Gee! two hours and a half long. It would break
my heart to sit still long enough to do it.”
</p>
<p>
Jess Morse had never tried to more than pass
in English composition. For the very reason,
perhaps, that she had seen the practical side of
such a career at home, she had not, like so many
girls of her age, contemplated seriously literary
employment for herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
Lily Pendleton was known to have once essayed
an erotic novel, and had read a few chapters
to some of her closer friends. Bobby said
it should have been written on yellow paper with
an asbestos pad under it to save scorching Miss
Pendleton’s desk. Of course, Lily would attempt
a play in the most romantic style.
</p>
<p>
The boys began to hatch practical jokes anent
the play-writing before the week was out; and
one afternoon Chet Belding appeared in a group
of his sister’s friends, and with serious face declared
he had with him the outline and introductory
scene of Laura’s play, its caption being:
</p>
<p>
“The Poisoned Bathing-Suit; or, The Summer
Boarder’s Revenge.”
</p>
<p>
Some of the girls—and not alone the Juniors
like Laura, Nellie and Jess—were very serious
about this matter of the play. Mrs. Kerrick’s
prize spurred every girl who had the least ability
in that direction to begin writing a dramatic
piece. Some, of course, did not get far; but the
main topic of discussion out of school hours
among the girls of Central High was the play
and the prize.
</p>
<p>
Jess talked it over with her mother, and Mrs.
Morse grew highly excited.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Josephine, dear, if you could win that
prize it would be splendid! Then you could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
have a new party dress—and a really nice one—and
the furs I have been hoping to buy you for
two seasons. Dear, dear! what a lot of things
you really could get for that sum.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess it would help us out a whole lot,” admitted
the girl “We need so many things——”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I shouldn’t allow you to use a cent of
it for the household—or for me,” cried her
mother. “No, indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t won it yet,” sighed Jess. “But
I guess if I did win it you’d have to take a part
of it, Mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense, child!” cried Mrs. Morse.
“We’ll have some checks in shortly. And we
sha’n’t starve meanwhile. Now, let us look over
this plot you have evolved and perhaps I can suggest
some helpful points—and show you how to
write brisk dialogue. That is something the editors
always praise me for—although I have
never dared try a play myself. It is so hard
to get a hearing before a really responsible manager.”
</p>
<p>
Outside help for the girls was not debarred
by the terms of the contest, so long as the main
thread of plot in each play was original with the
author, and she actually did the work. Jess
listened to the practical suggestions of her mother
in relation to her play; but all the time she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
upon her mind, too, the domestic difficulties that
seemed to have culminated just now in a single
great billow of trouble.
</p>
<p>
No money had come in. She had been obliged
to go once more to Mr. Hargrew for groceries,
and to the meat store and to Mr. Vandergriff’s.
Her mother could talk in her cheerful
manner about what she could do with the two
hundred dollar prize if she earned it. But Jess
was very sure that she would not spend it for
personal adornment—although no girl at Central
High loved to be dressed in the mode more
than Jess Morse.
</p>
<p>
“If such a <em>darling</em> thing should happen as
my winning the prize, I’d put it all in the bank
for a nest-egg,” she thought. “Then, when
checks do not come in, we would not have to ask
for credit. We’d pay up all debts and start
square with the world. And then—and then I’d
be perfectly happy!”
</p>
<p>
The first of the month arrived, and with it
Mr. Chumley. Mrs. Morse was busy at her desk
and said:
</p>
<p>
“Just tell him, Josephine, that we will have it
shortly. He needn’t come again. I’ll let you
take it around to his house to him when I get
it.”
</p>
<p>
But this did not suit the old man, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
pushed his way, for once, into the presence of
the literary lady.
</p>
<p>
“Now, see here! Now, see here!” he cackled.
“This won’t do at all, Widder—this won’t
do at all! I want my money, and I want it
prompt. And if you can’t pay your present rent
prompt, how do you expect to pay it next month,
when you must find three dollars more? Now,
tell me that, Ma’am?”
</p>
<p>
“Really, Mr. Chumley! You are too bad,”
complained Mrs. Morse. “I am so hard at
work. You quite drive the ideas out of my
head. I—I don’t know what train of thought
I was following.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Chumley snorted. “You’d better be
huntin’ the advertisement columns of a newspaper
for a job, Widder,” he said. “Them
‘trains of thought’ of yours won’t never carry
you nowhere. I gotter have my money. How
are you going to get it?”
</p>
<p>
“I have never failed to pay you heretofore,
have I?” asked the lady, bringing out her handkerchief
now. “I think this is too bad——”
</p>
<p>
“But I want money!”
</p>
<p>
“And you shall have it, I have considerable
owing to me—oh, yes! a good deal more than
sufficient to pay your rent, Mr. Chumley. You
will get it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
That was a very unsatisfactory interview for
the landlord, and particularly so for Mrs. Morse.
She complained when he had gone to Jess:
</p>
<p>
“Now, my day is just spoiled. I’m all at
loose ends. It will cost me a day’s work.
Really, Josephine, if only people wouldn’t nag
me so for money!”
</p>
<p>
And Jess strove to shield her all that she could
from such interviews. Mrs. Morse needed to
live alone in a world with her brain-children.
Meanwhile her flesh-and-blood child had to fight
her battles with the landlord and tradesmen.
</p>
<p>
It was amid such sordid troubles that Jess
evolved the idea for her play. The butterfly is
born of the ugly chrysalis; out of this unlovely
environment grew a pretty, idyllic comedy
which, although crude in spots, and lacking the
professional touch which makes a dramatic
piece “easy acting,” really showed such promise
that Mrs. Morse acclaimed its value loudly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mother! don’t praise me so much,”
begged Jess. “The theme is good, I know. But
it scares me. How can I ever dress it up to
make it sound like a real play? It sounds so
jerky and imperfect—that part that I have written,
I mean.”
</p>
<p>
“There is something a dramatic critic told me
once that may be true,” replied her mother. “It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
was that the piece which reads smoothly seldom
acts well; whereas a play that ‘gets over the
footlights’ usually reads poorly. You see, action
cannot be read aloud; and it is the action that
accompanies the words of a dramatic piece that
makes those words tell.
</p>
<p>
“I am not sure that Mr. Sharp and his
committee will consider your play the best
written, from a literary standpoint; but I understand
that they have invited Mr. Monterey, the
manager of the Centerport Opera House, to read
the plays, too. And you, Josephine, write for
<em>him;</em> for they will depend upon his judgment in
the choice of the acting qualities of the piece.”
</p>
<p>
This was good advice, as Jess very well knew.
And she could barely keep her mind sufficiently
upon her school work to pass the eagle scrutiny
of Miss Grace G. Carrington, so wrapped up was
she in the play. Not even to Laura did she confide
any facts regarding the piece. Some of the
girls openly discussed what they had done, and
what they hoped; but Jess kept still.
</p>
<p>
Thursday came and in her mother’s morning
mail was a letter with the card of the Centerport
<em>Courier</em> in the corner.
</p>
<p>
“Now, what can that be?” drawled Mrs.
Morse, when Jess eagerly brought it to her.
“They buy no fugitive matter, and I haven’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
sent them anything since having my interview
with Mr. Prentice. I really would have been
happier to see a letter like that from one of the
New York magazines; it might have contained a
check in that case,” and she slowly slit the
envelope.
</p>
<p>
But Jess waited in the background with suppressed
eagerness in her face and attitude. At
once her thought had leaped to Mrs. Prentice.
She had not told her mother a word about that
lady’s visit on Friday evening, nor her errand
to the house. But if Mrs. Prentice was really
“the power behind the throne” in the <em>Courier</em>
office, she might easily put some regular work in
the way of Mrs. Morse.
</p>
<p>
“Listen to this, child!” exclaimed her mother,
having glanced hastily through the letter. “Perhaps
I had better take this—for a time, at least.
I don’t like the idea of being tied down—it
might interfere with my magazine work——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mother!” cried Jess. “What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Listen: Addressed to me, ‘Dear Madam:—Will
reconsider your suggestion of covering Hill
section for society news. Can afford at least
five dollars’ worth of space through the week,
and perhaps something extra on Sunday. Come
and see me again. Respectfully, P. S. Prentice.’
Well!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mother!” repeated Jess. “What a
splendid chance!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Josephine, not so very splendid,” said
her mother, slowly. “He only guarantees me
five dollars weekly. That is not much.”
</p>
<p>
“It will feed us—if we are careful,” gasped
Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, Josephine! What a horribly
practical child you are getting to be. I don’t
know what the girls of to-day are coming to.
Now, that would never have appealed to me
when I was your age. I never knew how papa
and mamma got food for us.”
</p>
<p>
Jess might have told her that conditions had
not changed much since her girlhood!
</p>
<p>
“But five dollars regularly will help us a whole
lot, Mother,” she urged.
</p>
<p>
“And it will necessitate my going out considerably—and
appearing at receptions and
places. Really—I have refused a number of invitations
because of my wardrobe. My excuse
of ‘work’ is not always strictly true,” sighed
Mrs. Morse.
</p>
<p>
“But do, <em>do</em> try it, Mother!” cried Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the lady, “it may do no harm.
And it may be an opening for something better.
But, really, nobody must know that I am a mere
society reporter on the Centerport <em>Courier</em>.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—A SKATING PARTY</h2>
<p>
The girls of the Junior class in modern history
were filing out on Friday.
</p>
<p>
“What do you know about that?” hissed
Bobby Hargrew, in the ears of her chums.
“Gee Gee is getting meaner and meaner every
day she lives.”
</p>
<p>
“What did she do to you now?” demanded
Dora Lockwood, one of the twins.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you notice? She sent Postscript to
hunt up Moscow on the map of Russia. Now!
you know very well that Moscow was burned
in 1812!”
</p>
<p>
“You ridiculous child!” exclaimed Nellie
Agnew. “You will never do anything in school
but make jokes and try the patience of your
teachers.”
</p>
<p>
“I am no friend to teachers, I admit,” confided
Bobby to Dora and Dorothy. “Don’t you
think they ought to be made to earn their
money?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
</p>
<p>
“Any teacher who is so unfortunate as to
have you in his, or her, class, is bound to earn
all the salary coming to them,” declared Dorothy.
</p>
<p>
“Bad grammar—but you don’t know any
better,” declared the harum-scarum. “You’re
just as bad as Freddie Atkinson. Dimple asked
him who compiled the dictionary, and Freddie
said, ‘Daniel Webster.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No, sir! Noah!’ snapped Dimple.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, Professor!’ exclaimed Fred. ‘I
thought Noah compiled the Ark?’”
</p>
<p>
As the girls were laughing over this story of
Bobby Hargrew’s, Eve Sitz came up briskly.
Laura and Jess were near at hand, and in a
moment a group of the Juniors who always
“trained together” were in animated discussion.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. It’s frozen hard. Otto was on it with
a pair of horses and our pung,” declared Eve,
who came in every morning from the country
on the train, and whose father owned a big farm
over beyond Robinson’s Woods.
</p>
<p>
“What’s frozen?” demanded Dora.
</p>
<p>
“Peveril Pond. It’s as smooth as glass. I
want you to all come over on Saturday afternoon;
we’ll have a lot of fun,” declared Eve.
</p>
<p>
“You’re always inviting us to the farm, Evangeline,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
said Nellie Agnew; “I should think
your father and mother would be tired of having
us overrun the place.”
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind about them,” declared
Evangeline, smiling. “They love to have young
folks around. Now, remember! Saturday at
noon the autos will start from the Beldings’
front door—if it doesn’t snow.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, snow!” cried Bobby. “I hope not yet.”
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp;snow!&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;sing&nbsp;&nbsp;whom&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;suits—<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;object&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;‘cause&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;soaks&nbsp;&nbsp;through&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;boots!’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“It’s too bad,” said Jess, “that Mrs. Kerrick
didn’t offer a prize for verse. Bobby would win
it, sure!”
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind,” said Bobby, with mock
solemnity. “I may surprise you all yet. I am
capable of turning out tragic stuff—you bet
your boots!”
</p>
<p>
“Mercy, Bobby! how slangy you are getting,”
murmured Nell Agnew, the doctor’s daughter.
</p>
<p>
“You think I cannot be serious?” demanded
Bobby, very gravely. “Listen here. Here is
what I call ‘The Lay of the Last Minorca’—not
the ‘Last Minstrel!’
</p>
<p>
“‘She laid the still white form beside those
that had gone before,’” quoth Bobby, in sepulchral
tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘No sob, no sigh, forced its way from her
heart, throbbing as though it would burst.
</p>
<p>
“‘Suddenly a cry broke the stillness of the
place—a single heartbreaking shriek, which
seemed to well up from her very soul, as
she left the place:
</p>
<p>
“‘“Cut, cut, cut-ah-out!”
</p>
<p>
“‘She would lay another egg to-morrow.’”
</p>
<p>
“You ridiculous girl!” exclaimed Laura.
“Aren’t you ever serious at all?”
</p>
<p>
“My light manner hides a breaking
hear-r-r-t,” croaked Bobby. “You don’t
know me, Laura, as I really <em>are!</em>”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t want to,” declared Laura Belding,
briskly. “It must be awful to be a humorist.
All right, Eve. We’ll come on Saturday. Chet
will see Mr. Purcell about the big car. Lake
Luna is frozen only at the edges, and is unsafe.
But we will have a good time at Peveril Pond.”
</p>
<p>
Fortunately Mrs. Morse received payment for
a story in a magazine that week or Jess would
never have had the heart to join the skating
party. But the sum realized was sufficient to
settle with Mr. Closewick, pay the month’s rent
of the cottage, and pay a part of each bill at
Mr. Heuffler’s and Mr. Vandergriff’s shops.
</p>
<p>
These payments left Jess and her mother almost
as badly off as they were before. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
there was the new account started at Mr. Hargrew’s.
But Chet Belding urged Jess very
strongly to be his guest on Saturday, and there
was really no reason why Jess should not go.
Her mother had seen Mr. Prentice and begun
furnishing items to the <em>Courier</em> from day to
day; and the girl felt that, with care, they might
be able to keep from getting so deeply into debt
again.
</p>
<p>
No snow had fallen up to Saturday noon; but
it was cold, and the clouds threatened a feathery
fall before many hours. The young folk who
gathered in the big hall of the Belding house
thought little of the cold, however. There were
warm robes and blankets in the Belding auto
and in the sightseeing machine that Mr. Purcell
had sent. Chet, in his bearskin coat, looked like
the original owner of the garment—especially
when he pulled the goggles down from the visor
of his cap, and prepared to go out to the car.
</p>
<p>
“My dear fellow,” drawled Prettyman Sweet,
the dandy of Central High, who was of the
party, “you look howwidly fewocious, doncher
know! I wouldn’t dwess in such execrable taste
for any sum you could mention—no, sir!”
</p>
<p>
“Beauty’s only skin deep, they say, Pretty,”
responded Chet “So, if you were flayed, you
might look quite human yourself.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
“Purt” was gorgeous in a Canadian skating
suit—or so the tailor who sold it to him had
called it. It was all crimson and white, with
a fur-edged velvet cap that it really took courage
to wear, and fur-topped boots. And his
gloves! they were marvels. One of them lying
on the floor of the Beldings’ hall gave Topsy,
Mrs. Belding’s pet terrier, such a fright that
she pretty nearly barked her head off.
</p>
<p>
She made so much noise that Lance grabbed
at her and tried to put her out of the room,
Topsy still barking furiously.
</p>
<p>
“You look out!” drawled Bobby Hargrew.
“One end of that dog bites, Lance!”
</p>
<p>
They turned Purt around and around to get
the beauties of his costume at every angle. And
they “rigged” him sorely. But the exquisite
was used to it; he would only have felt badly if
they had ignored his new “get-up.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s quite the thing, I assure you,” he declared.
“And, weally, one should pay some attention
to the styles. You fellows, weally, dress
in execrable taste.”
</p>
<p>
When the party was complete they bundled
into their wraps again and piled into the machines.
Mrs. Belding had retired to her own
room until the “devastation of the barbarians,”
as she called it, was past; but Mammy Jinny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
straightened up the hall and dining room after
the young folk with great cheerfulness.
</p>
<p>
“Yo’ know how yo’ was yo’self, Miss Annie,
w’en yo’ was oberflowin’ wid de sperits ob
youth,” she said, soothingly.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure I never overflowed quite so boisterously,”
sighed Mrs. Belding.
</p>
<p>
“No. Yo’ warn’t one ob de oberflowin’ kind,
Miss Annie,” admitted the old black woman.
“But Mars’ Chet an’ Miss Laura, and dem
friends ob theirs, sartain sure kin kick up a
mighty combobberation—yaas’m!”
</p>
<p>
The wintry wind blew sharply past the crowd
of Central High Juniors as the Belding auto and
the bigger machine struck a fast pace when once
they had cleared the city. There was lots of
fun in the autos on the way to the Sitz farm;
but they were all glad to tumble out there and
crowd into the big kitchen “for a warm.”
</p>
<p>
The Swiss family were the most hospitable
people in the world. Eve’s mother had a great
heap of hot cakes ready for them, and there was
coffee, too, to drive out the cold.
</p>
<p>
“We’re going to take Patrick down to the
pond with us to keep up the fires while we’re
skating,” Eve told Laura. Eve looked very
pretty in her skating rig, and she was a splendid
skater, too. “Father and Otto are somewhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
down in the woods already. This cold weather
coming on marks the time for hog killing, and
some of the porkers have been running in the
woods, fattening on the mast. There is an old
mother hog that has gotten quite wild, and has
a litter of young ones with her that are hard to
catch. They may have to shoot her. So if
you hear a gun go off, don’t be alarmed.”
</p>
<p>
The hired man, who stayed with the Sitzes
all the year around, was a comical genius and
the boys knew him well. As they started on
the walk to the pond, Chet asked him:
</p>
<p>
“Do you skate yourself, Pat?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure, and it’s an illegant skater I used to
be when I was young,” declared Pat; “barrin’
that I niver had thim murderin’ knives on me
feet, but used ter skate on a bit of board down
Donnegan’s Hill.”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll never own up that he doesn’t know a
thing,” whispered Eve to Laura and Jess, as the
boys laughed over this statement of the Irishman.
“He was planting potatoes in the upper
field, and all by himself, last spring, and a man
drove along the road, and stopped and asked him
what kind of potatoes they were.
</p>
<p>
“‘Sure, I know,’ says Patrick.
</p>
<p>
“‘Then what kind are they?’ repeated the
neighbor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Sure, they’re raw ones, Mr. Hurley,’ says
he, and Hurley came to the house roaring with
laughter over it. Nothing feazes Patrick.”
</p>
<p>
The long, sloping hill, under the chestnuts and
oaks, would have made a splendid coasting place;
only there was no snow on the ground.
</p>
<p>
“But when the snow <em>does</em> come,” cried Dora
Lockwood, “if the pond is still frozen over,
won’t it be a great course?”
</p>
<p>
“The ice is all right now, at any rate,” Eve
reassured them. “And there isn’t a spring hole
in the entire pond, Otto says.”
</p>
<p>
Patrick had brought an axe and, with the help
of some of the boys, soon had a big bonfire burning
on the edge of the pond. Meanwhile the
other boys helped the girls with their skate-straps,
and then got on their own skates.
</p>
<p>
The ice hadn’t a scratch on it. It was like a
great plate of glass, and so clear in places that
they could see to the bottom of the pond—where
the bottom was sandy.
</p>
<p>
All the young folk were soon on the ice, the
boys starting a hockey game at the far end, and
the girls circling around in pairs at the end
nearest to the fire.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what Mrs. Case, our physical instructor,
says we ought to learn,” said Laura,
watching the boys.
</p>
<p>
“And it’s jolly good fun, too,” cried Bobby.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
“But suppose you turned your ankle, or fell
down and tore your dress?” suggested Nellie.
“I believe hockey on the ice is too rough.”
</p>
<p>
“No game needs to be rough,” declared
Laura. “That isn’t the spirit of athletics.
Didn’t we learn how to play basketball without
being rough?”
</p>
<p>
“Even Hessie Grimes learned that,” chuckled
Bobby.
</p>
<p>
At that moment a gun was fired back in the
thicker woods, and then out of the brush the
girls saw an animal charging directly for the
pond. Patrick saw it, too, and leaped up from
before the fire and ran toward the beast.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a big hog!” cried Bobby.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the one they want to catch,” said Eve.
“She is ugly, too, I believe.” Then she raised
her voice in warning to Patrick; “Look out,
Patrick! She is real cross.”
</p>
<p>
“Faith!” returned the Irishman, half squatting
down in the path of the charging sow. “It’s
not afraid I be of the likes of a pig. ’Tis too
many of their tails I’ve twisted in ould Ireland,
to run from wan in Ameriky——”
</p>
<p>
Just then the animal spied him and went for
Patrick, full tilt. There wasn’t time for the
Irishman to dodge; but he <em>did</em> spread his
legs, and the angry mother-hog ran between
them.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—THE MID-TERM EXAMINATION</h2>
<p>
The girls, who were nearest the end of the
lake, watched Patrick and the old hog in amazement.
The boys came down from the far end
with a chorus of yells and laughter.
</p>
<p>
For the Irishman, leaping up with his feet
apart, descended on the back of the charging animal,
with his face toward her tail!
</p>
<p>
The porker grunted her displeasure, and Patrick
did some grunting, too; but he was not
easily scared—nor would he be shaken off. He
locked his arms tightly around the animal’s body
and hugged her neck with his legs, so that she
could not bite him.
</p>
<p>
The creature kept up a deafening squealing,
while out of the bush rushed Dandy, the farmer’s
dog. The boys came sweeping in from the
lake to join in the sport—sport to everybody but
the pig and Patrick! But Dandy got into the
scrimmage first.
</p>
<p>
True to his instinct, the dog attempted to seize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
the hog by the ear, but miscalculated and caught
Patrick by the calf of the leg!
</p>
<p>
“Moses and all the children of Israel!”
bawled the Irishman. “’Tis not fair to set two
bastes onto wan! Call off yer dawg, Otto, or
it’s the death of him I’ll be when I git rid of
the hog.”
</p>
<p>
But just then the poor hog got rid of him.
She lay down and Patrick tumbled off, kicking
at the dog. Dandy seemed much surprised to
discover that he had locked his teeth on the
wrong individual!
</p>
<p>
The boys were convulsed with laughter; but
the girls were afraid that the Irishman had been
seriously hurt. And, from the squealing of the
hog, they were positive that <em>she</em> was suffering.
</p>
<p>
However, Mr. Sitz and Otto appeared, and
tied the legs of the struggling beast, and so bore
her away. They had already trapped her litter
of young ones, and Patrick limped after his
master and Otto, vowing vengeance against both
the hog and the dog.
</p>
<p>
So the boys took turns in keeping up the fire
on the shore, for although it was a clear day,
the wind continued cold and blew hard. They
were all glad to hover around the blaze, now
and then; and especially so when they ate their
luncheons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
Eve had prepared a great can of chocolate and
the girls had all brought well-filled lunch boxes.
Bobby was hovering about Laura’s as soon as it
was opened.
</p>
<p>
“Mammy Jinny’s made you something nice,
I know,” she said. “Dear me, I’m so hungry!
I wish I was like the Mississippi River.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that for?” demanded Prettyman
Sweet, who overheard her. “Like the Mississippi?
Fawncy!”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’d have three mouths,” exclaimed
Bobby, immediately filling the mouth she <em>did</em>
possess.
</p>
<p>
“My word! that wouldn’t be so bad an idea,
would it?” proclaimed Purt, who was a good
deal of a gourmand himself.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think much of this jam pie,” complained
Chet, holding up a wedge that he had
taken from his sister’s basket.
</p>
<p>
“That’s not jam pie!” exclaimed Laura.
“Whoever heard of jam pie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep. This is it,” declared Chet. “The
crusts are jammed right together. There ain’t
enough filling.”
</p>
<p>
The wind increased toward the end of the day
and it was hard to skate against it; but the young
folk had a lot of fun sailing down the length of
the pond with their coats spread for sails.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“That was a great scheme you suggested about
the kite the other day, Laura,” declared Lance
Darby. “It was as good as an aeroplane.”
</p>
<p>
“What would be the matter with hitching the
kite to our scooter?” suggested Chet, who overheard
him.
</p>
<p>
The two chums owned a small iceboat which
went, on Lake Luna, by the name of “scooter.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, old man! I’ve got a better scheme than
that!” cried Lance, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“What say?”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s combine a flying machine with an iceboat
and beat out everybody on the lake this
winter!”
</p>
<p>
“Wow!” shouted his chum. “Now, you’ve
been skating with Mother Wit and have caught
her inventive genius—it’s contagious. Gee! what
an idea!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. Wait till you hear my
scheme,” said Lance, wagging his head.
</p>
<p>
“It ought to work fine,” said Bobby Hargrew,
with serious face. “All you will have to
do when you are sailing along the ice and come
to open water will be to turn a switch and jump
right into the air. Save getting your feet wet.”
</p>
<p>
“Laugh all you want to,” said Lance, threateningly.
“When we get it done you girls will
be glad enough to ride in it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not I!” cried Nellie Agnew. “I wouldn’t
ride on your old scooter as it is. And to combine
a flying machine and iceboat—whew! I
guess not.”
</p>
<p>
The boys became enthusiastic, however, and
they talked about it all the way home. Lance,
however, kept the important idea regarding
the new invention for Chet Belding’s private
ear.
</p>
<p>
Jess Morse enjoyed the outing that Saturday,
as she always enjoyed such fun when with the
Beldings; but, after all her mind was on her
play. She almost lived that play nowadays!
</p>
<p>
And, to tell the truth, she began to neglect
some of her studies in her concentration of mind
upon “The Spring Road.” Her mother praised
it warmly.
</p>
<p>
“To think that I should have a daughter who
may turn out to be a real genius!” cried Mrs.
Morse. “Although it is <em>so</em> hard to get a play
accepted by a first-class producer.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I don’t want to be a genius,” said Jess
shaking her head. “But I <em>do</em> want awfully to
win that prize.”
</p>
<p>
“Such a sordid child,” said her mother, playfully.
“I cannot imagine one’s putting such emphasis
on mere money. It isn’t genius, after all,
I fear. Our friends would call you eminently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
practical, I suppose,” and the irresponsible lady
sighed.
</p>
<p>
But if Jess had no impractical thoughts regarding
<em>why</em> she wished to win the prize, she
made the mistake, just the same, of letting Miss
Carrington catch her two or three times in recitation
hour. Gee Gee was down on her like a
hawk.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Morse, what does this mean?” demanded
the stern teacher, eyeing Jess with particular
grimness through her thick spectacles.
</p>
<p>
She had called the culprit to her desk just
before the noon recess and now showed her the
enormity of her offenses.
</p>
<p>
“You are falling back. There is something
on your mind beside your textbooks, that is very
sure, Miss Morse. I cannot lay it to athletics
at present, I suppose, for there seems to be a
slight let-up in the activities of you young ladies
in that direction,” and she smiled her very scornfullest
smile. Miss Carrington abhorred athletics.
</p>
<p>
“But we have another matter interfering with
the placid current of our school life. Are <em>you</em>,
Miss Morse, one of the young ladies who are
attempting to write a play?”
</p>
<p>
“Ye—yes, ma’am,” stammered Jess, blushing
to her ears.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah! so I thought. I believe I can pick out
all these playwrights by a reference to their recitation
papers. And this afternoon comes our
mid-term examination. Let me tell you, Miss
Morse, that you must do better this afternoon,
or I shall take your case up with Mr. Sharp.”
</p>
<p>
She was folding and tying with a narrow ribbon
some papers as she spoke, and her eyes
snapped behind her glasses.
</p>
<p>
“These are the questions in my hands now,
Miss Morse,” said Gee. “And let me tell you,
they are searching ones. Be prepared, Miss—be
prepared!”
</p>
<p>
And she popped them into the top drawer on
the right-hand side of her desk. But before she
could shut down the roll top and so lock the
desk, Miss Gould appeared at the door of the
room and beckoned to Miss Carrington. The
latter rose hurriedly and departed, leaving her
desk open. And likewise leaving Jess Morse, her
hungry eyes fixed upon that drawer in which the
examination questions lay!
</p>
<p>
Just a peep at those papers might have helped
Jess a whole lot in the coming hour of trial.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—MISSING</h2>
<p>
Alice Long, who was Short and Long’s sister,
was entertaining some of the girls when
Jess Morse came into the recreation hall with
something her little brother Tommy had said.
</p>
<p>
“Tommy’s just going to school, you know,
and he’s beginning to ask questions. I guess he
stumps his teachers in the primary grade. He
heard the arithmetic class reciting and learned
that only things of the same denomination can
be subtracted from each other.
</p>
<p>
“‘Now, you know that ain’t so, Alice,’ says
he to me. ‘For, can’t you take four quarts of
milk from three cows?’”
</p>
<p>
Jess didn’t feel like laughing; what was coming
after recess troubled her. She felt a certainty
that she would fail, and she could not
get over it.
</p>
<p>
“Besides,” she said to herself, “Gee Gee will
put the hardest questions on the list to me—I
just know she will.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Jess?” asked Laura,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
coming up to her and squeezing her arm.
“Something is troubling you, honey.”
</p>
<p>
“And it will trouble you after recess,” replied
Jess, mournfully.
</p>
<p>
“The old exams?”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh!”
</p>
<p>
“Afraid, are you?” laughed Mother Wit.
</p>
<p>
“I’m just scared to death. And Gee Gee
knows I’m not prepared and she will be down on
me like a hawk.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe not.”
</p>
<p>
“She knows I am weak. She just told me so,
and she showed me the papers and said there
were awfully hard questions in them. She just
delights in catching us girls. And she says all
of us who are trying for the prize are neglecting
our regular work.”
</p>
<p>
“I expect we are, Jess,” admitted Laura.
“Oh, dear! it’s not easy to write a play, is it?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Jess, hesitatingly. “I’m
not sure that I am writing a regular play. But
I’m writing something!”
</p>
<p>
“What does your mother say about it?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, of course she praises it. She would.”
</p>
<p>
“I bet you win the prize, Jess!” exclaimed
Laura.
</p>
<p>
“No such luck. And, anyway, I will take no
prize this afternoon. Gee Gee threatens to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
my standing up with Mr. Sharp if I don’t do
well, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t worry, dear. Perhaps you will
come out all right.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby came swinging along and bumped into
them. “Oh, hullo!” exclaimed she. “Say!
how do you pronounce ‘s-t-i-n-g-y’? Heh?”
</p>
<p>
“Man or wasp?” returned Mother Wit,
quickly.
</p>
<p>
Jess laughed. “You can’t catch Laura with
your stale jokes, Bobby,” she gibed.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right; I asked for information.
But you girls don’t know anything. You’re
writing plays. That’s enough to give you softening
of the brain. The folks that know it all
are the squabs,” chuckled Bobby, referring to
the freshman class. “What do you suppose one
of them sprang this morning?”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t the least idea,” spoke Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Why, she was asked to define the difference
between instinct and intelligence, and she said:
‘Instinct knows everything needed without learning
it; but human beings have reason, so we have
to study ourselves half blind to keep from being
perfect fools!’ Now, what do you know about
that?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe that child was right,” sighed Jess.
“If I only had instinct I wouldn’t have to worry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
about the questions Gee Gee is going to give us
this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, say not so!” gasped Bobby, rolling her
eyes and putting up both hands. “I am trying
to forget about those exams——There’s the
bell! Back to the mines!” she groaned, and
rushed to take her place in the line.
</p>
<p>
The Junior class crowded into Miss Carrington’s
room and took their seats. The examination
covered several of the more important
studies. The teacher took her place, adjusted
the thick glasses she always wore, and looked
sternly over the room.
</p>
<p>
“Young ladies,” she said, in her most severe
manner, “I hope you are all prepared for the
review. But I doubt it—I seriously doubt it.
Some of you have been falling behind of late in
a most astonishing manner, and I fear for your
standing—I fear for it.”
</p>
<p>
This manner of approaching the exam, was,
of course, very soothing to the nervous girls;
but it was Gee Gee’s way and they should all
have been used to it by this time. She had
opened the drawer of her desk—the top right-hand
drawer—and was fumbling in it.
</p>
<p>
Pretty soon she gave her entire attention to
sorting the papers in this drawer, which seemed
to be pretty full. As the moments passed, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
manner betrayed the fact that the teacher was
much disturbed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I hope she’s lost ’em!” exclaimed the
wicked Bobby Hargrew.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t,” returned the girl she spoke to.
“We’d suffer for it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I got my fingers crossed!” chuckled
Bobby. “She can’t accuse me. I wasn’t near
her old desk.”
</p>
<p>
“Wasn’t it locked?” whispered another of
the waiting girls.
</p>
<p>
Miss Carrington heard the bustle in the class,
so she sat up and looked out over the room
with asperity.
</p>
<p>
“I want to know what this means, girls,” she
said, snappily. “My desk was left open by
chance while I was out of the room for perhaps
ten minutes. The examination papers were in
this drawer. Now I cannot find them. Has
somebody done this for a joke?” and she looked
hard in Bobby’s direction.
</p>
<p>
“Look out, Bob,” warned one of her mates;
“crossing your fingers isn’t going to save
you.”
</p>
<p>
But suddenly, even while she was speaking,
Miss Carrington seemed to be stabbed by a
thought. She started to her feet and turned her
gaze upon the part of the room in which Josephine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
Morse sat. And Jess’s face was aflame!
</p>
<p>
“Miss Morse!”
</p>
<p>
Gee Gee’s voice was never of a pleasing quality.
Now it startled every girl in the room. Jess
slowly arose, and she clung to the corner of her
desk a moment for support.
</p>
<p>
“Do you remember seeing me put those question
papers into this drawer? <em>Do</em> you?” demanded
the teacher.
</p>
<p>
“Ye—yes, ma’am,” replied Jess.
</p>
<p>
“You were standing right here at my desk?”
</p>
<p>
Jess nodded, while the whole class watched
her now paling face. Many of the girls looked
amazed; some few looked angry. Laura Belding’s
eyes fairly blazed and she half rose from
her seat.
</p>
<p>
“Sit down, young ladies!” commanded Miss
Carrington, who was quick to see these suggestive
actions on the part of the class. “Come
here to me, Miss Morse.”
</p>
<p>
Jess walked up the aisle. After that first moment
her strength came back and she held her
head up and stared straight into the face of the
teacher. The tears that had sprung to her eyes
she winked back.
</p>
<p>
“I had called you to my desk, Miss Morse,”
said Gee Gee, in a low voice, and staring hard
at the girl, “and had pointed out to you that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
this particular examination would be a trying
one. Is that not a fact?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am,” admitted Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Gould called me and I hastily thrust
the papers, which I particularly told you were
the question papers, into this drawer. Did I
not?”
</p>
<p>
“You did.”
</p>
<p>
“And then I hurried out of the room without
locking the drawer—without pulling down the
roll top of the desk, indeed. Is that not so,
Miss Morse?”
</p>
<p>
“It is,” said Jess, getting better control of
her voice now.
</p>
<p>
“And you were left standing here. The
other girls were gone. Now, Miss Morse, I
freely admit that I am culpable in leaving such
important papers in the way. I should have
locked them up. I presume the temptation was
great——”
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon, Miss Carrington!” exclaimed
the girl, more indignant than frightened
now. “You are accusing me without reason.
I would not do such a thing——”
</p>
<p>
“Not ordinarily, perhaps,” interposed Miss
Carrington. “But it all came to you in a moment,
I presume. And you did not have time to
put them back.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
This she had said in a low voice, so that nobody
but Jess heard her. But the girl’s voice
rose higher as she grew hysterical.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Carrington, you are unfair! I never
touched them!”
</p>
<p>
“You must admit, Miss Morse, that circumstances
are very much against you,” declared
the teacher.
</p>
<p>
“I admit nothing of the kind. A dozen people
might have been in the room while you were
out and the desk was open. Ten minutes is a
long time.”
</p>
<p>
“You seem to have thought out your defense
very well, Miss Morse,” said Gee Gee, sternly.
“But it will not do. It is too serious a matter
to overlook. I shall send for Mr. Sharp,” and
she touched the button which rang the bell in
the principal’s office.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>
“Come to order!” commanded Miss Carrington,
rapping on her desk with a hard knuckle.
</p>
<p>
She quickly gave the class in general a task
and sent Jess to her seat.
</p>
<p>
“I will speak with you later, young lady,” she
said, in her most scornful way.
</p>
<p>
Jess’s eyes were almost blinded by tears when
she went back to her seat. But they were angry
tears. The unkind suspicion and accusation of
the teacher cut deeply into the girl’s soul. She
could see some of the girls looking at her askance—girls
like Hester Grimes and Lily Pendleton,
and their set. Of course, they had not heard all
that Miss Carrington said; but they could easily
suspect. And the whole class knew that the
trouble was over the disappearance of the papers
for the review.
</p>
<p>
Bobby wickedly whispered to her neighbor
that she hoped the papers wouldn’t ever be
found. But that would not help Jess Morse out
of trouble.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
</p>
<p>
To Jess herself, hiding her face behind an
open book, the printed page of which was a mere
blur before her eyes, it seemed as though this
trouble would overwhelm her. It was worse
than the poverty she and her mother had to face.
It was worse than having no party dress fit to
be seen in. It was worse than being refused
credit at Mr. Closewick’s grocery store. It was
worse than having old Mr. Chumley hound them
for the rent
</p>
<p>
Reviewing the whole affair more calmly, Jess
could understand that Miss Carrington would
consider her guilty—if she could bring herself
to think any girl of Central High would do such
a thing.
</p>
<p>
Jess sat there, dumb, unable to work, unable
to concentrate her mind on anything but the horribly
unjust accusation of her teacher. How she
disliked Gee Gee!
</p>
<p>
The other girls were not particularly devoted to
the task set them for the moment, either. Laura
did not sit very near her chum in this room.
She asked permission to speak with Jess and
Miss Carrington said:
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss Belding; sit down!” and she said
it in her very grimmest way. Usually the teacher
was very lenient with Mother Wit, for of all her
pupils Laura gave her the least trouble.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
A feeling of expectancy controlled the whole
roomful of girls. It came to a crisis—every girl
jumped!—when the door opened and Mr. Sharp
walked in.
</p>
<p>
The principal of Central High seldom troubled
the girls’ class rooms with his presence. When
he addressed the young ladies it was usually <em>en
masse</em>. He trusted Miss Carrington, almost entirely,
in the management of the girls.
</p>
<p>
His rosy cheeks shone and his eyes twinkled
through his glasses as he walked quickly to the
platform and sat down beside Gee Gee at her
table, which faced the girls, whereas her roll-top
desk was at the rear of the platform, against the
wall of the room.
</p>
<p>
Principal and teacher talked in low voices for
some moments. Mr. Sharp cast no confusing
glances about the room. He ignored the girls,
as though his entire business was with their
teacher.
</p>
<p>
At length he looked around, smiling as usual,
Mr. Sharp was a pleasant and fair-minded man
and the girls all liked him. He had their undivided
attention in a moment, without the rapping
of Miss Carrington’s hard knuckle on the table
top. Bobby said that that knuckle of Gee Gee’s
middle finger had been abnormally developed by
continued bringing the class to order.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
“Young ladies!” said Gee Gee, snappily.
“Mr. Sharp will speak to you.”
</p>
<p>
The principal looked just a little annoyed—just
a little; and for only the moment while he
was rising to speak. He never liked to hear
his pupils treated like culprits. He usually
treated them at assembly with elaborate politeness
if he had to criticise, and with perfect good-fellowship
if praise was in order. This little
scene staged by Miss Carrington grated on him.
</p>
<p>
“Our good Miss Carrington,” said he, softly,
“has sustained a loss. Important papers have
been mislaid, we will say.”
</p>
<p>
He raised his hand quickly when Miss Carrington
would have spoken, and she was wise enough
to let him go on in his own way.
</p>
<p>
“Now, the question is: How have the papers
been lost, and where are they at the present moment?
It is a problem—in deduction, we will
say. We must all partake of the character of
some famous detective. It used to be a rule in
our family when I was a boy that, if a thing
were lost, it was wisest to look for it in the most
unlikely places first. I can remember once, when
father lost a horse, that mother insisted in shaking
out all the hens’ nests and giving them new
nests. But father never <em>did</em> find that horse.”
</p>
<p>
The girls had begun to smile now; and some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
of them giggled. Miss Carrington looked as
she usually did when Mr. Sharp joked—it pained
her and set her teeth on edge. Bobby declared
she looked as though she had bitten into a green
persimmon.
</p>
<p>
“Joking aside, however,” continued the principal.
“This loss is a serious matter. Suppose
you young ladies suggest how the question
papers to be used in this mid-term examination
have been whisked out of this drawer of Miss
Carrington’s desk, and hidden elsewhere? Can
it be possible that it is the prank of a pixy? Of
course, all of you young ladies are too serious-minded
to do such a thing yourselves.”
</p>
<p>
There was a general laugh, then, and the strain
of the last few minutes began to be relieved.
Somehow, even Jess Morse felt better.
</p>
<p>
“To suggest that anybody in this class—the
Junior class of Central High—would deliberately
misappropriate these questions is beyond imagination,”
declared Mr. Sharp, with sudden gravity.
“It is a mistake. The mistake is explainable.
Has anyone a suggestion to make?”
</p>
<p>
It was Laura Belding who broke the silence.
She asked her question very modestly, but her
cheeks were flushed, and she was evidently indignant.
</p>
<p>
“Is—is it positive that the papers were put in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
that top drawer that Miss Carrington now has
open?”
</p>
<p>
“Ask Miss Morse!” snapped the teacher, before
Mr. Sharp could reply.
</p>
<p>
“We will. Nothing like corroboration,” said
the principal, with a bow and smile. “Miss
Morse?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” said Jess, in a low voice, rising.
“I saw her put them there. She tied them into
a bundle by themselves.”
</p>
<p>
“You are observant, Miss Morse,” said the
principal, smiling again. “Thank you. Now,
Miss Belding?” for Laura was still standing.
</p>
<p>
“I notice that the drawer is very full,” said
Laura, quietly. “May I come upon the platform
and look at it?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” responded Mr. Sharp; but Miss
Carrington flushed again, and exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“I have searched that drawer thoroughly.
The papers are not there.”
</p>
<p>
Again Mr. Sharp made a little deprecatory
gesture, “Come forward, Miss Belding,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
Mother Wit gave her chum a single reassuring
glance. Somehow, without reason, that look
comforted Jess. She still stood beside her desk,
too anxious to sit down again, while Laura walked
quietly forward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“That drawer is very full, Mr. Sharp,” she
said, composedly enough. “May I take it
out?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ve had it out and felt behind it,” urged
Miss Carrington, all of a flutter now.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe Miss Belding can show us something
we did not know,” said the principal, in his
bantering way. It had been he who gave Laura
her nickname, and he thought a great deal of
the girl. He knew that she had some serious
intention or she would not have come forward.
</p>
<p>
Laura pulled out the over-full drawer and set
it down upon the carpet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it isn’t there,” said Miss Carrington.
“The packet was tied with a mauve ribbon—a
narrow ribbon——”
</p>
<p>
Laura pulled out the next drawer.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s quite useless,” exclaimed the lady
teacher. “And to have everything disarranged
in this way——”
</p>
<p>
“We must give the counsel for the defense
every opportunity, Miss Carrington,” said the
principal softly.
</p>
<p>
Laura drew out the third drawer—just glancing
at the top layer of papers—and then the
fourth and last. No bundle tied with a mauve
ribbon appeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not there!” exclaimed Gee Gee, and was
there a spice of satisfaction in her voice?
</p>
<p>
But Laura dropped upon her knees, ran her
arm to the shoulder into the aperture where the
last drawer came out, and drew forth the missing
packet of papers, which lay crowded back upon
the carpet.
</p>
<p>
“There!” said Mr. Sharp, quite in a matter-of-fact
tone, “I have suggested to the Board of
Education more than once that all these old unsanitary
desks should be done away with. The
only roll-top desk fit to use in the schools are
those which stand upon feet, the bottom of the
lower drawer being a few inches from the floor.
Thank you, Miss Belding! We will now go on
with the afternoon session.”
</p>
<p>
But he rested his hand for a moment upon
Laura’s shoulder, as she was about to step down
after returning the drawers to their places in the
desk.
</p>
<p>
“The counsel for the defense did very well,”
he whispered, and then left the room as quietly
as he had entered it.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Sharp had relieved Miss Carrington of the
embarrassment of his presence; but she certainly
was troubled by the untoward incident. Laura
returned to her seat by the way of Jess’s and
boldly squeezed her hand. And Jess thanked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
her, in her heart. The rebound from being suspected
of the loss of the papers gave her such
relief that the coming examination seemed much
less terrible. Or perhaps, Miss Carrington was,
after all, a little easy on her that afternoon; for
Jess Morse came through the grilling with surprisingly
high marks.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—A WAY IS OPENED</h2>
<p>
But Jess had had ample warning. There
would be something important heard from Gee
Gee if she neglected the regular work of her
classes to devote time and thought to that wonderful
play.
</p>
<p>
It was hard to keep her mind off a task that
had so gripped her heart and mind. “The
Spring Road” was in her thought almost continually.
She even dreamed about it at night.
And it was a veritable wrench to get her mind
off the idyl of youth she was writing to set it
upon the grim realities of Latin, English, the
higher mathematics, and other school tasks.
</p>
<p>
It seemed to Jess Morse as though no other
piece of writing could ever be so enthralling as
this she had undertaken. When she had begun
it it was with fear and trembling. The two hundred
dollar prize was what spurred her to the
task. But now, she fairly loved it!
</p>
<p>
“The Spring Road” was a fantasy—a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
comedy—a love story; it was all three in one, and she
was writing it with the limitations of those who
would probably play it, in mind.
</p>
<p>
Many of the contestants for Mrs. Kerrick’s
prize thought not at all about the players; but
already in Jess’s mind was fixed who, of her
schoolmates, would best fit into the parts. There
was a character who could not gain much sympathy
from the audience, but who could wear
beautiful clothes—that would just suit Lily Pendleton.
</p>
<p>
And for the Spring Spirits, in the allegory,
<em>Budding Tree</em> and <em>Laughing Brook</em>, who could
be better fitted than Dora and Dorothy Lockwood?
While the heroine of the story must be
beautiful Kate Protest, of the Senior class, and
the <em>Truant Lover</em> the sparkling Launcelot Darby.
</p>
<p>
At home matters were not going as smoothly
as Jess had hoped, after her mother obtained
regular work upon the Centerport <em>Courier</em>. It
was nice to get the money regularly for that
work; but somehow Mrs. Morse could not see
the wisdom of “paying as you go.” Jess could
not always take cash with her when she went to
the stores; and if her mother chanced to be out
herself and saw something particularly nice that
Jess was likely to fancy, she ordered it in without
regard to how it was to be paid for.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
But that had always been Mrs. Morse’s way.
She was over-generous with Jess while she, herself,
went with shabby gloves and mended shoes.
But any sensible plan of retrenchment in their
household expenses had never been evolved in
her mind.
</p>
<p>
How they were to meet the added burden of
the January rent never seemed to trouble her.
Jess only spoke of it once during that first fortnight
in December; then it disturbed her mother
so much that the lamp of genius refused to burn
for a whole day, and, with a sigh, the girl gave
over discussing the point.
</p>
<p>
Checks for her mother’s stories came few and
far between these days, Jess feared that they
would soon owe Mr. Hargrew as large a bill as
they had at Mr. Closewick’s store. And as for
a new dress—well, the idea of that was as far
in the offing as ever.
</p>
<p>
All the girls she knew well were so busy scribbling
away at their prize plays that, had Jess been
free herself out of school hours, she would have
been unable to find any of her usual companions
at leisure.
</p>
<p>
Even Chet Belding, who was always at her
beck and call, was terribly busy these days. He
and Lance Darby were hard at work upon some
wonderful sort of ice craft they were building
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
down in Monson’s old boathouse, near the Girls’
Branch Athletic League field and boathouse.
</p>
<p>
Each day saw the wintry winds grow colder,
and soon the ice upon Lake Luna was thick
enough to bear. Some of the more reckless boys
had skated out to the steamboat channel, which
had been sawed from the open water in the middle
of the lake, so that the freight boats from
Lumberport and Keyport could get to their docks.
</p>
<p>
Ice of such thickness on Lake Luna at this
early date, however, surprised even that apocryphal
person, “the oldest inhabitant.” And Jess
Morse would have been glad of a new coat, or the
set of furs that her mother had talked about.
When she started for school some mornings, the
first blast of keen air off the lake seemed to cut
through her like a knife. She wouldn’t have had
her mother know how really thin her apparel
seemed for anything in the world.
</p>
<p>
And, very wisely, she kept up her gym. work
faithfully. A few minutes’ vigorous exercise
after the regular day’s work at school was finished
put her in a glow, made her breathe more
deeply and “put a shine in her eyes,” as Bobby
expressed it.
</p>
<p>
“There isn’t a girl in the class who doesn’t
need brisking up in the gym. this weather—unless
it’s Eve Sitz,” confided Bobby to Laura and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
Jess as they left the gymnasium building together
one afternoon. “Girls are just like cats; they
all like to mope around the register or the steam
radiator in cold weather. Why, Lil Pendleton
wears a lace shawl over her shoulders in the
house, and hangs over the gas-log like an old
woman. We all ought to get back into basketball—and
at the rowing machines—again. Once
a week on the court isn’t enough to keep us
alive.”
</p>
<p>
“If you knew the number of things Eve Sitz
does, in and out of doors, before she comes to
school in the morning, and after she gets home
again, you wouldn’t wonder that she keeps her
color, and is so brisk and strong,” laughed Laura.
</p>
<p>
“I expect she is a busy little bee,” admitted
Bobby.
</p>
<p>
“She helps milk the cows night and morning——”
</p>
<p>
“There!” interrupted the irrepressible Bobby.
“That’s what I’ve always intended to ask Eve;
but I forget it.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Why, when you have finished milking a cow,
how do you turn the milk off?”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t she the ridiculous girl?” chuckled
Laura, as Bobby ran up the side street toward
her own door. Then Mother Wit turned on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
chum, with her brisk, bird-like way: “How’s
the play going, Jess?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m—I’m afraid it’s finished,” said her chum,
slowly.
</p>
<p>
“‘Afraid!’” repeated Laura, in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. As far as I can finish it.”
</p>
<p>
“But you’re not going to give it up in the
middle?” cried Laura.
</p>
<p>
“No. It is complete. Only it doesn’t satisfy
me,” returned Jess, shaking her head. “And it
never will.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! there speaks real genius!” declared
Laura, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you believe it,” was her friend’s hasty
reply. “I just don’t know enough to write it
well enough to suit me.”
</p>
<p>
“Modesty!”
</p>
<p>
“Sense,” corrected Jess, laughing a little dolefully.
“How are you getting along?”
</p>
<p>
“Just as Mr. Sharp said, I am no female
Shakespeare,” said Laura. “But I have hopes
that maybe my play isn’t so bad.”
</p>
<p>
Jess was not sanguine about “The Spring
Road,” however. She knew that it might be
written so much better, if one only knew how!
</p>
<p>
And while they discussed the play Jess heard
somebody calling her by name. Laura grabbed
her arm and pointed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that Mrs. Prentice—the very rich Mrs.
Prentice—in her electric runabout? And, I declare,
Jess! she’s calling to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I know her; she wants me,” said Jess
breathlessly, and she ran across the street to
where the electric car was standing beside the
curb.
</p>
<p>
“I want you, child,” said the lady, with decision.
“Can you excuse yourself to your
friend?”
</p>
<p>
Jess waved her hand to Laura, and called:
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be up after supper, dear.”
</p>
<p>
Laura nodded, and smiled, and went on; but
she was evidently puzzled as she turned to gaze
after the runabout as it moved off swiftly with
her chum beside the lady in the magnificent furs.
</p>
<p>
“And how are you and your mother getting
along?” asked Mrs. Prentice, as soon as the
car had started.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why about as usual, Mrs. Prentice,”
stammered Jess, who was much puzzled as to
why the lady should want her to take this ride.
“Only mother is regularly employed by Mr.
Prentice, and is very grateful for the work—as
you must know, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t speak of that,” said Mrs. Prentice,
laughing. “I fancy that Pat is getting full measure
for his money; he usually does. But tell me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
child, are you going to remain in that cottage
of Mr. Chumley’s?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—I really don’t know, Mrs. Prentice.
There seems no other place to go——”
</p>
<p>
“He is horribly overcharging you, child,” said
the lady, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“I know. But there are so few small places
in decent neighborhoods—mother says she
doesn’t know what to do about it.”
</p>
<p>
“I fancy, Jessica——Is that your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Josephine, Mrs. Prentice; only they all call
me Jess.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well—Jess. Sounds a good practical
name—and you are a practical girl; I can see
that. Now, Jess, I fancy you have to do something
yourself toward moving, to get your mother
started, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! but I don’t know where to go——”
</p>
<p>
The car began to slow down. Mrs. Prentice
had run into a quiet side street, not two blocks
from the cottage at the foot of Whiffle Street.
</p>
<p>
“See here,” said the lady, stopping the motor
and preparing to alight. “I want you to see this
little dove-cote—that’s what I have always called
it. It is set behind a grassy front yard and there
is a little garden at the back. You’ll love it
in spring and summer.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but Mrs. Prentice, is it empty?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s too empty. That’s the trouble. The
tenant I had left unexpectedly.” She neglected
to say that she had paid the tenant a certain sum
to leave the cottage and move into another house.
“I don’t want the house empty during the cold
weather. I have paid to have a fire kept up in
the furnace for a week so that the pipes would
not freeze. Come in.”
</p>
<p>
It was a dear little cottage; Jess Morse was
delighted with it. And so much more convenient
than Mr. Chumley’s. Besides, there was a good
reason why the owner paid to have the fires kept
up all this week of cold weather. Every room
was fresh with paint and paper—the smell of
varnish was still plain. It was really a delightful
little place and the furniture at home would
fit into the several rooms so nicely!
</p>
<p>
Jess Morse saw all this at once. She was delighted——And
two dollars less a month than
the cottage in which they had lived so long!
</p>
<p>
“It is a way opened, Mrs. Prentice!” she murmured.
“Better than we could ever expect. I
thank you from the very bottom of my heart!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—IN SUSPENSE</h2>
<p>
But when Jess got home—and Mrs. Prentice
took her there in the car, but would not come in
herself—she had hard work to satisfy her mother
that such a change as this opportunity suggested
was a good one for them to make. In short,
Mrs. Morse did not enthuse.
</p>
<p>
“Just think of the trouble of it all,” she sighed.
“My dear Jess, we have been here so long——”
</p>
<p>
“But Mr. Chumley doesn’t want us any longer,”
interposed Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Tut, tut! that is only the old gentleman’s
way. He really will not raise our rent, do you
think?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mother!” expostulated the girl, “he
has already raised it and threatened to put us out
if we don’t find the increased three dollars on
the first.”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid you were not politic enough,”
said her mother.
</p>
<p>
“One cannot be politic with Mr. Chumley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
He wants his house for another tenant; he has
as good as said so. And <em>do</em> come and see Mrs.
Prentice’s little cottage. It is a <em>love</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Even after she had seen it, however, Mrs.
Morse was doubtful. She shrank from the
change.
</p>
<p>
“And think of the expense of moving,” she
declared.
</p>
<p>
“But the two dollars less we pay a month will
soon pay for <em>that</em>,” said Jess, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Well—er—perhaps,” admitted her mother,
doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
Jess had to do it all, however. She had to attend
to every detail of the change. Fortunately
her mother received a check of some size and the
daughter obtained a part of it for current expenses.
She hired a truckman, packed most of
their possessions after school hours, and saw to
the setting up of their goods and chattels in
the new home.
</p>
<p>
There were several tons of furnace coal in the
cellar of the new home. In the old cottage there
had been no heater. Mrs. Prentice told Jess that
she could pay for the coal a little at a time, and
the girl gladly availed herself of this advantage.
</p>
<p>
For the winter promised to be a severe one.
Since frost had set in in earnest there had been
no let-up. Jess and her mother moved during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
the short holiday vacation. The day school
closed; the contestants for the prize offered by
Mrs. Kerrick handed in their plays. The announcement
of the successful one would be after
the intermission—on the first Monday of the
New Year.
</p>
<p>
When the Morses really came to remove their
goods from the house in which they had lived so
long, old Mr. Chumley would have liked to get
out an injunction against their doing so.
</p>
<p>
“I never thought you’d do it, Widder!” he
croaked, having hurried over the minute he heard
the moving man was at the door. “Why—why
mebbe we could have split the difference. P’r’aps
three dollars a month more was a leetle steep.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” sighed Mrs. Morse. “Really,
Mr. Chumley, this is Jess’s doings. She thinks
the change will be better for us——”
</p>
<p>
“Now then! I wouldn’t let no young’un snap
me like I was the end of a whip!” cried the old
man. “You bundle your things back into the
house, and we’ll call it only a one-fifty raise.”
</p>
<p>
But here Jess interfered. “Are you prepared
to take two dollars off the rent, instead of adding
any, and will you make the repairs we have been
asking for all this year, Mr. Chumley?” she demanded,
briskly.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! I can’t. It ain’t possible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
The property don’t bring me enough as it is.”
</p>
<p>
“Then there’s no use talking to us,” said Jess,
drawing her arm through her mother’s. “Mrs.
Prentice’s house is all freshly done over, and has
a heater, which this house hasn’t, and everything
is in spick and span order.”
</p>
<p>
“That Mrs. Prentice! I might ha’ knowed
it!” cackled Mr. Chumley. “And she was for
having you arrested for stealing once.”
</p>
<p>
This was the very first Mrs. Morse had heard
about the night Jess had had her queer experience,
and she had to be told all about it now.
She saw at once that her own regular work for
the <em>Courier</em> arose out of her daughter’s acquaintance
with the wealthy Mrs. Prentice.
</p>
<p>
“And she is one of the leaders in our Hill
society!” gasped the poor lady. “I declare! I
shall never be able to face her again—although
I have only a bowing acquaintance with her. She
will very well know who is putting all the society
items into the paper.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s honest,” said Jess, stubbornly.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! How practical you are,
Jess,” exclaimed her mother. “Isn’t anything
but bread-and-butter, and such things, appealing
to you in life, child?”
</p>
<p>
Jess did not answer. She was naturally as
frivolous of mind as any other girl of her age,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
only the happenings in their domestic life of
the last few weeks had made her far more
thoughtful.
</p>
<p>
And really, the little dove-cote, as Mrs. Prentice
had called their new home, was a veritable
love of a place! Mrs. Morse had to admit herself
that it was a great improvement over the
house where they had lived so long.
</p>
<p>
As it was vacation week, she let Jess go right
ahead to settle things while she stuck to the typewriter.
And Jess was glad to have plenty to occupy
her mind. The suspense of waiting for the
committee to decide upon the winner of the prize
was hard to endure indeed.
</p>
<p>
One evening, however, Chet came after her,
for there was a big moonlight skating party on
Lake Luna. By this time people who had horses
and sleighs had made quite a trotting course
from Centerport to Keyport in one direction, and
from Centerport to Lumberport at the other end
of the lake.
</p>
<p>
There were certain motor enthusiasts, too, who
had rigged their cars so that they would travel
on the ice; but Chet Belding and Lance Darby
had beaten them all. The trotting course hugged
the shore, the skaters followed the same course,
but farther out on the ice, and beyond, toward
the middle of the lake, the iceboats had free
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
swing. And there were several very fast “scooters”
and the like upon Lake Luna.
</p>
<p>
But Laura’s brother and his chum declared
that “they’d got ’em all beat to a stiff froth!”
And on this night they produced the finished product
of their joint work for the last several
weeks.
</p>
<p>
“What do we call it? The <em>Blue Streak!</em>”
declared Chet. “And that’s the way she travels.
We tried her out this morning and——Well,
you girls will admit that you never traveled fast
before.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me, Laura! Do you think it
is safe for us to venture with them?” demanded
Jess.
</p>
<p>
“If Chet brings me home in pieces he knows
what mother will do to him,” returned her chum,
laughing.
</p>
<p>
The novel boat certainly attracted considerable
attention when the boys ran it out of the old
boathouse and pushed it far away from the skating
course. It combined the principles of an aircraft
with runners of the familiar iceboat.
</p>
<p>
“Just call it an aero-iceyacht, and let it go at
that,” said Chet. “That hits it near enough.”
</p>
<p>
“And it really can sail in the air or on the ice—like
a hydroplane?” demanded Jess.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll think so,” Chet assured her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
The boat was driven by a propeller similar to
those on aeroplanes; and this propeller was fastened
to the crossbeam on which were the two forward
runners—somewhat similar to the mast on
the ordinary lake iceboat. The body and rudder
plank, at right angles to this crossbeam, supported
the two-cylinder gasoline engine, which
Chet bought at the motor repair shop of Mr.
Purcell.
</p>
<p>
It was a fourteen-horse-power engine, water-cooled,
and geared with a chain to the propeller.
</p>
<p>
“We tried a belt first,” said Lance; “but the
blamed thing slipped so that old Chet evolved the
chain-gear idea. Great, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“How can we tell till we see it work?” demanded
Laura.
</p>
<p>
“And you don’t have to lie down for ‘low
bridge’ when the boom goes over on this iceyacht!”
cried Jess, enthusiastically. “We can
sit up.”
</p>
<p>
“All the time,” agreed Lance.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s simply great!” declared Laura.
</p>
<p>
“All because you, Mother Wit, suggested using
the kite for motive power that day,” said her
brother, admiringly. “That gave us the idea.
If a kite would give motive power to a man skating,
why not use a more up-to-date air-power
scheme on the ice?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
“And it worked!” shouted Lance.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, hurry!” cried Jess. “I’m crazy to see
how it sails.”
</p>
<p>
The boys placed the girls amidships, and
showed them how to cling to the straps on either
side. Lance took his place on the crossbeam—to
act as weight on either end if such balance
was needed; Chet took the tiller.
</p>
<p>
“Open her up!” the latter commanded his
chum. “Only quarter round with the switch
when the engine gets her stroke. Now, careful!
Hang on, girls!”
</p>
<p>
The next moment the engine began to throb
regularly, and the blades of the propeller whirled.
In half a minute they had gained such momentum
that the eye could not distinguish the blades
themselves—they simply made a blur in the
moonlight.
</p>
<p>
The craft lunged ahead.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—A MILE A MINUTE</h2>
<p>
The moon, hanging low upon the horizon,
was young but brilliant. The air was so keen
and clear that without the help of the moonlight
it seemed as though the stars must have flooded
the lake with white light.
</p>
<p>
Nearer the southern shore the jingle of sleigh-bells
and the laughter and shouting of the skaters
marked the revelers who gave a free course to
the iceboats out here nearer the open water.
For both east and west of Cavern Island, which
lay in the middle of Lake Luna, opposite Centerport,
the ice was either unsafe, or there were long
stretches of open water. The freight boats up
and down the lake kept this channel open.
</p>
<p>
But there was a wide and safer course before
the flying aero-iceboat. And soon she was moving
so fast that the girls heard nothing but the
shriek of the wind rushing by.
</p>
<p>
Here and there before them lanterns glowed
like huge fireflies. These lights were in the rigging
of several ice-yachts. Chet and Lance had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
a pair of automobile searchlights rigged forward
on their own boat.
</p>
<p>
Another yacht had started from the old boathouse
at about the time our friends and their
new-fangled craft got under way. There were
girls aboard it, too; but at first the Beldings and
Jess and Lance did not recognize the other party.
</p>
<p>
The strange yacht was distinguished, however,
by a red and green lamp. As Chet had been slow
in starting, the other boat got ahead. But now,
although the wind was fair and the other yacht
traveled splendidly, the aero-iceboat bore down
upon it, beating it out and leaving it behind like
an express train going by a freight.
</p>
<p>
However, Chet would not allow Lance to
throw on all speed. There were too many other
craft on the ice before them—and it was night.
</p>
<p>
The lights of the City of Centerport soon fell
behind them; then, almost at once, they picked
up the lights of Keyport at the extreme end of
the lake. They were traveling some!
</p>
<p>
Chet had strapped on a megaphone, which he
had borrowed from Short and Long, who was
coxswain of the boys’ Central High eight-oared
shell, and through this he shouted his orders to
Lance. They ran down within a mile of Keyport,
and then shut off the engine and circled
about on the momentum they had gained. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
were too many skaters and sleighs on the ice
down here to make iceboating either safe or
pleasurable.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! Wasn’t that fun?”
gasped Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Felt like you was traveling some, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Chet! it was great!”
</p>
<p>
“It certainly is a fine boat, Bobby,” agreed
Laura. “You and Launcelot have done well.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait!” said Lance, warningly.
</p>
<p>
“Wait for what?” demanded Laura.
</p>
<p>
“We didn’t travel that time. We were only
preparing you—warming her up, as it were.
Wait till we let her out.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” cried Jess. “Can you go
faster?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll show you, going home,” said Chet.
</p>
<p>
Just then the boat with the green and red light
swooped down upon them and a voice shouted:
</p>
<p>
“What kind of a contraption is that you’ve
got there, Belding?”
</p>
<p>
“Hullo!” exclaimed Chet. “That’s Ira Sobel’s
yacht. Ira is Purt Sweet’s cousin.” Then
he answered: “Oh, this is a little rigging of my
own, Mr. Sobel. But she can travel. Rather
beat’s your <em>Nightkawk</em>, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, she did that time,” admitted Sobel,
doubtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me!” the friends heard the
Central High dandy exclaim. “I weally wouldn’t
want to travel any faster, Ira. I—I haven’t
weally got my breath yet!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I say!” cried another voice from the iceboat,
and they recognized Lily Pendleton’s.
“What do you think about the prize? Did you
hear?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, they haven’t decided on the best play
yet, have they?” returned Jess, eagerly, and before
her chum could speak.
</p>
<p>
“No, But I heard they’d put it all into Mr.
Monterey’s hands. He’s the manager of the
Opera House, you know. And mother is very
well acquainted with him. You girls laughed at
my play——”
</p>
<p>
“Not I, Lily,” interrupted Laura, good-naturedly.
“I was too afraid that the rest of you
might have a chance to laugh at mine.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I bet I’ve a good chance to win. Mr.
Monterey is real nice, and mother is going to see
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” exclaimed Chet. “She’s one of
those people who think influence brings things
about. Don’t you be worried, girls; I bet Mr.
Sharp won’t let anybody get that prize through
favoritism.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s very encouraging, Chet,” said Jess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
“But perhaps Lily will win it. You know, she
goes to plays more than any other girl in the
Junior class of Central High, that’s true. And
she reads novels—real silly ones. Maybe she
knows how to write just what would please a
theatrical manager.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” said Laura, “I’m not giving up all
hope yet—especially because of Lil Pendleton’s
say-so.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, look out!” shouted Lance. “All
ready to go back, Chet?”
</p>
<p>
“Start her!” exclaimed his chum, “Cling
tight, girls—and take a good breath. I want
to time this trip. It’s all of nine miles to the
starting point and we’ll show you——”
</p>
<p>
His voice trailed off and the girls did not hear
the rest of his speech. The big propeller-wings
began to beat the air, and the sound rose to a
keen buzzing. Chet snapped his watch back into
his pocket, raised his hand, and the iceboat tore
ahead.
</p>
<p>
In twenty seconds the wind rushed past them
so that the girls were forced to bend their heads.
The way was clear and Lance had “let her out.”
Chet bent sidewise watching the ice through his
goggles. Occasionally he screamed an order to
his chum, who signaled with his hand that he
heard and understood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
It was like the flight of a meteor! Laura and
Jess never had realized before what it meant to
travel fast. Motoring on land was nothing like
this. As though shot out of some huge cannon
the aero-iceboat skimmed the lake. The wind
was almost in their faces, but that made little
difference to this new invention of the chums.
</p>
<p>
The other yachts had to tack against the wind;
not so the aero-iceboat. Swift and straight she
flew and suddenly Chet roared to Lance to shut
down, and the propeller groaningly stopped.
</p>
<p>
Chet flung up his goggles and drew out his
watch.
</p>
<p>
“Eight and a half minutes!” he cried, with
glee. “And, as I told you, it’s a good nine
miles.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me off! let me off!” gasped his sister,
struggling down from the narrow body of the
boat. “Why! I never want to travel any faster,
Chet. Do you think it is <em>safe?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“You bet it is, Miss Laura,” said Lance.
“Or we wouldn’t have invited you girls to go
with us.”
</p>
<p>
“Just wait till some day—say Saturday. By
daylight I’d drive this thing faster than that. I
tell you, we’ve got the speediest craft on the
whole lake.”
</p>
<p>
“It beats what Mrs. Case told us about ski
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
running in Sweden,” cried Jess, who was delighted
with the experience. “And if Mrs.
Case starts a class to travel on skis this winter,
I want to be in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! it’s all right to hear about. But the
experience is sort of shaking,” sighed Laura.
“I’m not sure that I have an over-abundance
of pluck, after all.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—“JUST LIKE A STORY BOOK”</h2>
<p>
The Morses were completely settled in their
little house before school opened. Jess had had
a busy vacation, but aside from her ride on
Chet’s and Lance’s <em>Blue Streak</em> she had joined
in little of the holiday fun of her mates at Central
High.
</p>
<p>
There was one basketball game during the
holiday recess. Central High met the Keyport
team on their own court and outplayed them
most decidedly; therefore the athletic temperature
went up several degrees.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Case, the physical instructor of Central
High, was an enthusiastic out-of-doors woman,
and as a heavy snow fell about New Year’s she
easily interested the girls under her instruction
in skiing. This exercise, she pointed out, might
take the place of the fortnightly walking expeditions
during the snowy weather, and there was so
much broken country behind Centerport that the
sport could be indulged in with profit.
</p>
<p>
The boys were getting so much sport out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
ice hockey that—as the league approved of that
form of exercise—the physical instructor introduced
it on the girls’ athletic field. The field
could be flooded, and had been; now it was a perfectly
smooth piece of ice and upon it those of
the older girls who were already good skaters,
had a chance to learn the mysteries of hockey.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! Father Tom says it’s nothing but old-fashioned
‘shinny’ with a fancy name tacked
onto it,” declared Bobby Hargrew. “But my!
isn’t it fun?”
</p>
<p>
Jess and her chum, as well as the irrepressible,
“took” to hockey, and there were enough of the
other girls interested for two good teams to be
made up.
</p>
<p>
Hester Grimes captained one team and Laura
the other. There was still some little feeling of
rivalry between Hester and Mother Wit—perhaps
not much on the side of the latter; but the
wholesale butcher’s daughter was inclined to be
overbearing, and was never really satisfied unless
she had an important part in whatever went on.
</p>
<p>
The struggle between the two teams for supremacy
among the girls of Central High in this
particular sport really led, however, to good results.
Hester was backed by strong players; and
being so muscular a girl herself she carried her
side to victory two out of every three times.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
“We ought to beat her—she’ll get too uppity
to live with,” declared Bobby, discussing these
games.
</p>
<p>
“It will do us good to be beaten occasionally,”
laughed Laura. “You begin to think, Bobby,
that you must belong to the winning side all the
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Who doesn’t?” sniffed Miss Hargrew.
“It’s all right—all this talk about playing
the game for the game’s sake; but right down
in the bottom of our hearts, don’t all of us play
to win? If we don’t, we never play well, that’s
as sure as shooting.”
</p>
<p>
When the school re-opened, however, on the
first Monday in January, the subject uppermost
in the minds of the girls of Central High was the
prize contest in play-writing for the M. O. R’s.
The girls crowded into Assembly that morning,
all on the <em>qui vive</em> to hear what the principal
would have to say.
</p>
<p>
But after the opening exercises, when Mr.
Sharp came forward to speak, he surprised everybody
by saying:
</p>
<p>
“We are not ready to report upon the matter
of the plays. Mr. Monterey will confer with us
at noon, and before school is dismissed to-day
we will announce the winner.
</p>
<p>
“It is not often that a committee having in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
charge the decision of the winner in an amateur
play-writing competition has the happiness to
be aided by a professional manager of a theater,
and a man, too, who has produced plays of importance
himself.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Monterey’s knowledge of what will <em>act</em>
well will make our final decision, I believe, one
that will strike all competitors as eminently fair.
We have tried to decide upon the prize winner
in a way that will satisfy the giver of the prize,
too—Mrs. Kerrick. She demanded a play that
would act well and that will draw an audience
because of its dramatic value as a play—not
merely because it is written by a girl of Central
High, or is performed by the girls and their
friends for the benefit of the M. O. R’s.
</p>
<p>
“Before the day closes, I can promise you,
the decision will be made and the name of the
prize-winner, and of the title of the play, will be
announced. You are excused to your lessons for
the morning.”
</p>
<p>
The buzz of excitement—especially from the
girls’ side—when Mr. Sharp had ceased speaking,
could scarcely be controlled. Not even Miss
Carrington’s basilisk eye could quell it.
</p>
<p>
Of course, poor Bobby fell a victim to Gee
Gee’s sour temper. She thought the teacher had
long since reached the class room, and she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
gabbling away to Nell Agnew and Jess “sixteen
to the dozen,” as she would have said herself.
When out of a door popped the bespectacled
Miss Carrington, grimmer and more stern
than usual.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, Miss! are you supposed to rattle
away like that about matters entirely foreign
to your lessons, on the way to class room?”
demanded the teacher.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, indeed, Miss Carrington,” exclaimed the
contrite Bobby (she always <em>was</em> contrite when
caught in a fault, for all her sauciness and lightness
arose from thoughtlessness) “I really forgot—I
did not mean to make a noise in the corridor.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! did not mean—did not mean?
What excuse is <em>that</em>, pray?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a very good one, I am afraid,” admitted
Bobby. “But I truly did not intend to break a
rule. We were all so much interested in the
play——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Quite so. It is evident that I will get
little out of you young ladies until the matter
of this silly play is settled. I presume you are
one of the contestants, Miss Clara?”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all, Miss Carrington,” said Bobby,
demurely. “I <em>did</em> start to write one. It—it
would have been a tragedy based upon several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
of the main incidents in the Punic Wars. But
I found that to give the matter proper attention
I should be obliged to neglect some of the studies,
and——”
</p>
<p>
“That will do, Miss Hargrew,” interposed the
teacher, severely. “You bring me on Friday
afternoon a resume of those same Punic Wars—say
a thousand words, I shall learn thereby just
how much you know about the subject you selected
for your play.”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Bobby deserved what she got; but
she “pulled a dreadfully long face” about it,
while the other girls were inclined to enjoy her
chagrin.
</p>
<p>
As for Jess Morse, it seemed to her that the
waiting for the announcement of the prize-winner
was too hard a cross to bear. So much depended
upon the decision of the committee—it
did seem as though she could not keep her mind
upon the lessons.
</p>
<p>
If she won—<em>if she won!</em>—there would be plain
sailing in the domestic waters of the Morses’ life—and
that had come to mean a great deal to the
girl. For even Mrs. Prentice’s kindness to them
had not cleared away all the troubles for Jess
Morse.
</p>
<p>
True, the account at Mr. Closewick’s had been
paid. Jess, too, had seen to it that the month’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
rent for their new home was met and a little
something paid each week on the running store
accounts.
</p>
<p>
But when Mrs. Morse drew her salary for the
last week from the <em>Courier</em>—and it amounted to
nearly ten dollars that week—she had been
obliged to pay the money over to her dressmaker.
She had found it necessary to order a new costume,
if she was to follow the fashionable receptions,
and the like, on the Hill. This matter of
her mother being a society reporter, Jess feared,
would cost them more in the end than it was
worth to them.
</p>
<p>
And now they began the New Year with positively
nothing in the family purse. And there
was so much needed. There would be another
reception at the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. house this very week
and Jess told herself that she could not go because
of her lack of a gown. Ah! these things
were all veritable tragedies to her.
</p>
<p>
Lily Pendleton was very sure that she was going
to take the prize. And she was not afraid
to talk about it.
</p>
<p>
“Mother saw Mr. Monterey, and I am sure he
was impressed by what she told him,” she announced.
“Why, when the New Century Club
met at our house last week, I read two acts of
my play, and all the ladies said it was fine.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you modest!” grumbled Bobby. “I
should think it would pain you.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t you get saucy, Bobby,” warned
Lily. “<em>You</em> are not interested in this contest,
that’s sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” cried Bobby. “I knew better than
to try to write any such thing. If I won the
prize nobody would believe that I wrote it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Bob,” said Dora Lockwood. “You are
<em>too</em> modest.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir—ree!” returned Bobby. “I know
it. I am of the same modest and withdrawing
nature as the turtle.”
</p>
<p>
“The turtle?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” said Bobby, “You know what the
little boy said when he first went into the country?
He came running to his father and says:
‘Oh, Dad! what’s this thing I found? When I
poked it, it put its hands and feet in its pockets
and swallowed its head!’ Now, there can’t be
anything much more retiring than the turtle—or
<em>me</em>.”
</p>
<p>
The bell called them in for the final session
then, and half an hour before closing time the
signal from Mr. Sharp’s office announced that
the girls of all classes were to file to the Assembly
hall and take their seats. On this occasion
the boys were not present.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“If I don’t get it I hope you do, Jess,” whispered
Laura Belding to her chum as they went to
their seats.
</p>
<p>
But to herself Jess kept saying: “Oh, it
would be too good to be true—too good to be
true! It would be just like a story-book.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Sharp was smiling when he rose to speak.
</p>
<p>
“I must admit that I am surprised—happily
surprised,” he began. “Several of the plays
submitted to the committee are really marked by
a vigor of style and originality of text and plot
that have delighted me. Particularly are ‘The
Strong Defense,’ by Miss Belding, ‘Appearances,’
by Miss Hilyard, ‘The Arrow’s Flight,’
by Miss Agnew and ‘Harrowdale,’ by Miss Buford
to be praised upon these points.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, there were some handed in to
the committee that were utterly unintelligible;
the writers had not grasped the first principles
of play-writing. But, as a whole, I am proud of
your efforts, and I know Miss Gould is. I only
fear that many of you young ladies who began
plays did not finish them. It narrowed the
choice down to a very few.
</p>
<p>
“And yet,” pursued Mr. Sharp, “there was
really little doubt in the minds of any of the
committee at the first reading of the manuscripts.
And when the plays considered, from a literary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
standpoint, really acceptable, were put in the
hands of Mr. Monterey for a final reading and
judgment, we were assured that our opinion was
correct.
</p>
<p>
“There is but one, among them all, that is a
really <em>actable</em> (pardon the coining of the word),
and that one, too, has in it the elements of a
really heart-moving story. The author has failed
in many of the professional rules of play-writing—even
her grammar is somewhat shaky in
spots,” added Mr. Sharp, smiling suddenly.
“But the story is so sweet and so moving, and
is so well fitted to the acting capacity of you girls
and your brothers, that there is not the shadow of
a doubt as to the worth of the piece and the success
of the writer.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment he was silent. The girls were
eager, Lily Pendleton preened herself in her
seat. Her play had not been named when the
principal gave lukewarm praise to those mentioned.
She was sure that he now referred to
her and to her play.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Jess Morse had lost all
hope. Her poor little play was not even mentioned,
as Chet would have said, “among the
also rans!”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad to announce—and to congratulate
the young lady at the same time,” said Mr. Sharp,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
“that Miss Josephine Morse is the winner of the
two hundred dollars offered by Mrs. Kerrick, the
title of her play being ‘The Spring Road.’”
</p>
<p>
It came like a thunderbolt! Jess could only
gasp and stare up at him until his smiling, rosy
face, and the big spectacles, were blurred in a
mist that seemed to rise before her like a curtain.
</p>
<p>
Bobby Hargrew started the cheering; but it
was Laura who reached Jess first and hugged her
<em>tight</em>.
</p>
<p>
“I’m just as disappointed as I can be!” she
cried. “I actually thought <em>my</em> play was going
to be best. But as it wasn’t—— Why, Jess,
I’m almost as happy over your winning it as you
can be yourself!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—LILY PENDLETON IS DISSATISFIED</h2>
<p>
“I consider it a very unfair decision—unfair
in every particular,” proclaimed Lily Pendleton,
after school. “Why, he did not even <em>mention</em>
‘The Duchess of Dawnleigh.’ I can’t believe
that Mr. Monterey even <em>saw</em> my play. I certainly
shall make inquiries.”
</p>
<p>
Bobby Hargrew was caustic. “‘The Duchess
of Dawnleigh!’” she repeated. “Say Lil!
would you really know a live duchess if you saw
one coming up the street? Why didn’t you write
about something you knew about?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I know as much about duchesses as
<em>you</em> do, Bobby Hargrew!”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” granted Bobby, cheerily. “If
I had to go up against a duchess—a real, live
one—I expect I’d be like the little milliner in
Boston, when some great, high-and-mighty personages
came there from England. One of them
was a sure-enough duchess, and she sent for the
little milliner to do some work for her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
“The little workwoman was just about scared
into a conniption,” chuckled Bobby, “when she
found she had to go to the grand hotel to meet
the grand lady and so asked a friend who knew
a little more about the nobility than <em>she</em> did,
what she should do when she entered the grand
lady’s presence.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why, when you enter the room,’ explained
the friend, ‘merely bow, and in speaking to her
say “Your Grace.”’
</p>
<p>
“The little milliner,” continued Bobby,
“thought she could do that all right, and she
went to the interview with the duchess without
any dress rehearsal. When she got inside the
lady’s door she bowed very low and says, right
off:
</p>
<p>
“‘For what we are about to receive, Oh, Lord,
make us truly grateful!’”
</p>
<p>
But While there may have been some disappointment
in the hearts of some of the girls of
Central High who had striven for the prize, they
not yet having heard Jess Morse’s play read, even
the disappointed ones were not niggardly with
their congratulations.
</p>
<p>
Jess walked in a maze that afternoon when she
went home, Laura on one side and Nell Agnew
on the other, while Bobby pirouetted around them
like a very brilliant and revolving planet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“And is there a part in your play for me?”
demanded the irrepressible. “I just dote on actin.
But no thinking part for mine, young lady!
I must at least be important enough in the play
to say: ‘Me Lord! the carriage waits.’”
</p>
<p>
“You could play the part of <em>Puck</em> or <em>Ariel</em>,
Bobby,” declared Nellie Agnew.
</p>
<p>
“Hah! did you use those characters in ‘The
Arrow’s Flight’?” gibed Bobby. “No wonder
it was turned down then. Stealing boldly from
Shakespeare!”
</p>
<p>
“No, I didn’t, Miss!” returned Nell, rather
sharply. “I hope you noticed that I was one
of those who was ‘honorably mentioned.’”
</p>
<p>
“Sure. Mr. Sharp let you all down easy,”
chortled Bobby.
</p>
<p>
“I believe the decision in the contest was eminently
fair,” declared Laura. “Yet I thought I
would surely win.”
</p>
<p>
“So did I,” cried Nell.
</p>
<p>
“And I didn’t even dare <em>hope</em> for it,” said
Jess, awe-stricken. “It’s just the most wonderful
thing that ever happened.”
</p>
<p>
But Mrs. Morse took the success of “The
Spring Road” quite as a matter of course.
</p>
<p>
“There, Josephine!” she exclaimed. “Now
you can have the new clothes you are really suffering
for——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
Jess decided that the argument might as well
come right then. So she halted her mother on
the verge of her plans for renewing the girl’s
wardrobe in a style more befitting the means of
Lily Pendleton’s mother, than her own!
</p>
<p>
“We have got to pay our debts,” declared the
girl, warmly. “Every penny must be paid,
Mother, dear. Let’s be free of bills and duns
for once, at least. Let us start square with the
world—and stay square if we can.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Morse did not wish her daughter to use
the prize money for their general needs. Jess
had much trouble to convince her that it would
make her, Jess, far happier to do that than to
own the finest set of furs, or the most beautiful
evening gown, that would be displayed upon the
Hill that winter.
</p>
<p>
She did agree, finally, however, to have a new
dress so that she could attend the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. reception
that week, at which her play was read
aloud by Miss Gould herself, and it was praised
by the audience until Jess’s ears fairly burned.
Then the committee properly appointed went into
executive session and plans for the production
of “The Spring Road” went with a rush.
</p>
<p>
It was easy to choose a cast of characters.
With a little advice from Jess it was not hard to
select the very girls and boys best fitted to act
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
in the piece. And such selection was made that
very week, the typewritten ‘sides’ distributed to
the several players, and the boys and girls went
to work to memorize their parts. Lance Darby
and Chet Belding were both in the play, and although
neither Laura, nor Jess herself, had a
part, they were both so busy (for they were on
the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. play committee) that for a few
days athletics and sports were well-nigh neglected.
</p>
<p>
Through the good-natured manager of the
Centerport Opera House, scenery and much of
the properties and some costumes for the inferior
characters were to be obtained. But the principal
characters would furnish their own costumes,
and that is where Lily Pendleton began to lose
her dissatisfaction. Disappointed as she had
been regarding the decision of the committee,
when she found that she was cast for an important
part in Jess’s play she “came out of the
sulks,” as Bobby termed it.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Monterey suggested to the committee, too,
the name of a man to take charge of the rehearsals—really,
to be stage director of “The
Spring Road.” He came to the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R. house
one afternoon to read the play—a dapper, foreign-looking
man of an indeterminate age, who
continually twirled a silken black mustache and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
listened devotedly to any girl who talked to him.
</p>
<p>
Lily began to cultivate Mr. Pizotti assiduously.
Really, one might have supposed <em>she</em> had written
the play, instead of Jess Morse, she was so frequently
in conference with Mr. Pizotti that first
afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Bobby, who had likewise been cast for a part
in “The Spring Road,” watched Lily’s actions
with the stage manager with a good deal of disgust.
</p>
<p>
“What do you know about that foolish girl?”
she demanded. “I’ll wager that greasy foreigner
has got a wife and ten children—and neglects
them. He has brilliantine on that moustache,
and he smells of hair-oil, and I’ll wager,
too his hair will show gray at the roots, and I
<em>know</em> it is thin on top.”
</p>
<p>
“How wise you are, Miss Bobby,” said Nellie,
who heard her. “For a child you seem to have
learned a lot.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m foxy,” returned Bobby, grinning impishly.
“I’m fully as smart as that kid brother
of Alice Long’s. He came up to see us the other
day—Alice brought him. Aunt Mary is real
old fashioned, you know, and she sat in the kitchen
darning and Tommy was playing around
the floor. She thought it was getting toward
tea time and she said to him:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Tommy, go into the front hall and see if
the clock is running, that’s a good boy.’
</p>
<p>
“Tommy came back after a minute, and says:
</p>
<p>
“‘No, ma’am, it ain’t running; it’s standing
still. But it’s wagging it’s tail!’”
</p>
<p>
“And there’s Lil putting on her hat in a hurry
so as to meet the man when Miss Gould is
through with him, and walk down the block——Did
you ever?” exclaimed Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Pretty Sweet!” groaned Bobby. “<em>His</em>
nose is out of joint. He has been Lil’s bright
and shining cavalier for months. Dear, dear
me! The Duchess of Dusenberry—was <em>that</em> the
name of Lil’s play?—sure does have her favorites,
and like the <em>Queen of Hearts</em> in “Alice in
Wonderland,” has only one command for her discarded
courtiers: ‘Off with their heads!’” and
Bobby giggled as she peered from the window to
watch the dapper Mr. Pizotti and Lily Pendleton
walk down the street side by side.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—THE SKI RUNNERS</h2>
<p>
The New Year had ushered in the first big
fall of snow—and it kept coming. Every few
days, for the following fortnight, snow fell until
Centerport’s street-cleaning department was
swamped, and the drifts lay deep upon the vacant
lots and against fences and blind walls.
</p>
<p>
Skating was done for, for the ice on the lake
had become overloaded, and had broken up into a
shifting mass of blocks, grinding against each
other when the wind blew, and threatening the
safety of any craft that tried to put out in it.
</p>
<p>
So traffic on Lake Luna ceased, and, of course,
iceboating was likewise impossible. Chet and
Lance Darby, had they not been so extremely
busy learning their parts in the new play, could
not have used their aero-iceboat during this time.
Sleds were out in force, however—bobsleds,
double-runners, toboggans, “framers,” and every
sort of coasting paraphernalia. Even the Whiffle
Street hill was made a coasting place by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
young folk of the neighborhood, much to the
despair of some grouty people who had forgotten
their own youth, and who either telephoned their
complaints to the police, or sprinkled ashes on the
slide in the early morning hours.
</p>
<p>
It was at this time, however, that Mrs. Case,
the girls’ physical instructor of Central High,
took her class in ski running out into the open.
</p>
<p>
At first the dozen or more girls had practiced
on their athletic field, which was now snow-covered,
too. It was a particularly odd experience
to stand upon narrow boards of ash, some
ten feet in length, and then try to shuffle along
on them without tipping sideways, or plunging
head-first into a drift.
</p>
<p>
Each ski runner held a pole, with a spike in
one end, and this was an aid to balancing, as well
as of additional use if one tumbled down. It was
no easy task, the girls found, to get up when they
had been thrown into a drift.
</p>
<p>
“My!” commented Bobby Hargrew, “if you
cross your feet going down hill on these things,
you’re likely to dislocate every joint in your
body.”
</p>
<p>
“Be sure you do not cross your feet, then,”
advised Mrs. Case, grimly. “I have shown you
all the correct position to stand upon these skis.
The professional ski runner does not even use a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
pole. He will take the steep sides of mountains
at a two-mile a minute rate. I have seen them
do so in Switzerland and in Sweden and Norway.
And they will jump into the air from the verge
of high banks, and land on the drift at the bottom
with perfect balance.”
</p>
<p>
“This is going to be no cinch to learn,” pronounced
Bobby. “I know it’s going to be some
time before I am good enough at it to jump off
the top of Boulder Head on Cavern Island—now
you see!”
</p>
<p>
“You would better take a much less difficult
jump first,” advised Mrs. Case, smiling. “It
will be enough fun for us to learn to travel on the
skis without any frills. In Europe—especially
on the road between St. Moritz and Celerina—I
have often seen ski riders with horses. A
horse trots ahead, drawing several riders on skis,
who cling together by the aid of a rope fastened
to the horse’s collar. Sometimes each rider has a
horse, and they race horses just as though they
were riding in sleighs.
</p>
<p>
“It is great sport, but like every other healthful
form of athletics, it is often made dangerous
and objectionable by those who are reckless, or
rough. We will learn to balance ourselves, and
to coast down a gentle descent.”
</p>
<p>
So, the next Saturday, the teacher and more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
than a dozen girls of Central High piled into a
big, straw-filled sleigh, and were whisked out into
the hills south of the city. The inn at Robinson’s
Woods—a popular picnicking ground in
summer—was made their headquarters, and
there they left the sleigh and took to the difficult
skis.
</p>
<p>
The climb to the top of the bluff overlooking
the speedway, on which everybody—almost—who
owned a sleigh was driving that afternoon,
was not an easy one for the girls. Mrs. Case,
holding her body erect, yet easily, shuffled up
the incline with such little apparent effort that
some of her pupils were in despair.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll never be able to run as you do, Mrs.
Case!” cried Dora Lockwood. “Never! Why—ouch!
There, I came near tumbling down that
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Keep your balance. Use the pole if you have
to,” advised the instructor. “It is not a running
motion—it is more like a slide.”
</p>
<p>
“Say!” growled Bobby, who was having
trouble, too. “It beats the ‘debutante slink,’
that came in with narrow skirts. I feel as if I
was tumbling down every second.”
</p>
<p>
But they gained confidence in time. They
reached the top of the bluff and then the long,
easy slope, right beside the speedway, spread,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
spotless, before them. Mrs. Case showed them
how to start, and after a fashion several of the
bigger girls reached the bottom of the hill, and
then panted up again, pronouncing it the best
ever!
</p>
<p>
Bobby would not be outdone, as she said, “by
anything in skirts,” and so she ventured. Halfway
down the hill one of her skis must have
struck something—perhaps the stub of a bush
sticking out of the snow. Whew! Bobby
turned almost a complete somersault!
</p>
<p>
She was buried so deep in a drift—and head
first, at that—that it took both Laura and Mrs.
Case to pull her out.
</p>
<p>
“Oh-me-oh-my!” cried Bobby, who looked
like an animated snow-girl for the moment.
“And just as I was getting on so well, too!
Wasn’t that mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you’d better not try any more to-day,
Clara” said the instructor.
</p>
<p>
“And let those other girls get ahead of me?
Well! I guess not!” declared Miss Hargrew,
and she ploughed back to the top of the hill,
fastened her feet upon the skis again, and started
once more.
</p>
<p>
Laura and Jess Morse were on the hilltop,
looking out upon the white track over which the
sleighs were flying.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
“Look there!” gasped Jess, seizing her chum’s
arm. “Isn’t that the Pendletons’ sleigh?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course it is. With the big plumes and
the pair of dappled grays? And that stiff and
starched coachman driving? No mistake,” admitted
Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s in the sleigh with Lil?” demanded
Jess.
</p>
<p>
“As I live!” cried her chum, in a somewhat
horrified tone. “It—it is that Pizotti—that
man!”
</p>
<p>
“Can you beat her?” said Jess, shaking her
head.
</p>
<p>
“How foolish!” added Laura. “He is not
a good man. He has known her so short a time—and
to go sleigh-riding with her. Lil will be
talked about, sure enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t know as <em>we</em> need to worry
about her,” said Jess, shrugging her shoulders.
</p>
<p>
But Laura Belding could not put her schoolmate’s
indiscreet actions out of her mind so
easily. She wondered if Mrs. Pendleton knew
of Lily’s familiarity with the foreign-looking
Pizotti. The man might know his business as a
stage director; but he certainly was neither of
the age, nor the condition in life, to be cultivated
as a friend by any young girl.
</p>
<p>
Lily Pendleton was so foolishly romantic, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
so crazy about theatrical matters, that to be noticed
by any person connected with the stage, or
theatrical affairs, quite turned her head. And
then, she still talked a great deal about her own
play, “The Duchess of Dawnleigh.” She was
sure it had not been given a proper reading—especially
by Mr. Monterey. Perhaps, for reasons
best known to himself, this stranger, Mr.
Pizotti, had promised the foolish girl that he
would help her get “The Duchess of Dawnleigh”
produced.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—THE FIRST DRESS REHEARSAL</h2>
<p>
Laura Belding was a particularly frank, outspoken
girl, and when she met Lily Pendleton
that Saturday night at the rehearsal of Jess’s
play, she came out “flat-footed,” as her chum
would have said, with the question:
</p>
<p>
“Who was that in the sleigh with you to-day,
Lil?”
</p>
<p>
Lily flushed instantly, bridled, and smiled.
“Who do you s’pose?” she returned.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe your mother knew you had
that theatrical man to drive with you,” said
Laura, bluntly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, how you talk! I merely met Signor
Pizotti, and took him up——”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know who he is,” spoke Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, indeed, Miss! And do <em>you?</em>” demanded
Lily, rather sharply.
</p>
<p>
“No, And I don’t want to know him.”
</p>
<p>
“He is a very scholarly man—and he knows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
all about staging this play. If it wasn’t for him,
I guess, ‘The Spring Road’ would suffer from
frost,” said Lily, with an unkind laugh.
</p>
<p>
“That may be,” said Laura, flushing a little
herself, for any slur cast upon her chum’s play
hurt her, too. “But his knowledge of how to
produce or stage a play does not establish his private
character.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! you are interfering in something that
you know nothing about,” declared Miss Pendleton,
loftily. “And it does not concern you at all.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not believe your mother would approve,”
ventured Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind about my mother,” snapped
Lily, and turned her back on Mother Wit.
</p>
<p>
The latter took herself to task later, thinking
she had been too presumptuous.
</p>
<p>
“But really,” she said to Jess, on their way
home that evening, “I did not mean to be.
Only, the man looks so unreliable. I’m afraid
of him.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not afraid of him,” said Jess, decidedly.
“I only dislike him. But there is no accounting
for tastes. My mother knew of a foolish girl
who wrote to an opera tenor—one of those
handsome, spoiled foreigners, and she sent him
her photograph and told him how much she liked
his singing—and all that. Just a silly letter, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
know. But she didn’t sign her name and she
thought he would never learn who she was.
</p>
<p>
“But he went to the photographer,” continued
Jess, “and bribed him to tell who the girl was,
and by that time she had written to the man
several times, and he had written to her. So
then he threatened her that if she did not give
him five hundred dollars he would send her letters
to her father. And she was in dreadful
trouble, for she was afraid of what her father
would do.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Lil won’t do anything like <em>that!</em>” gasped
Laura. “I don’t believe she even thinks she
<em>cares</em> about that Pizotti. It is only his foreign
way that makes it appear so. But I believe he
is flattering her about her play, and perhaps
will get money from her or her mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Pizotti! Ha!” grunted Jess, before they
separated. “I’m like Bobby Hargrew: I don’t
believe that’s even his name. It sounds too
fancy to be a <em>real</em> name.”
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Pizotti was an able man in his business.
He came from time to time to the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.
house and his advice regarding the play was always
practical. He was something of a musician,
too, and played the accompaniments for the
girls who sang in “The Spring Road.” He suggested
improvements in the costumes, too; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
Lily Pendleton was entirely guided by his taste
in her choice of the gowns she was to wear in
the production.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Pendleton was a very busy woman in a
social way and allowed her daughter to do about
as she pleased. Lily aped the manners of girls
who had long since graduated from school and
were flashy in their dress and manners.
</p>
<p>
To tell the truth, the after-hour athletics, governed
by Mrs. Case, had been the one saving
thing in Lily Pendleton’s life for some months.
She would have become so enamored of fashion
and frivolity, had it not been for the call of athletics,
that she would have fallen sadly behind
in her school work.
</p>
<p>
But she liked certain activities enjoyed by
those who were attentive to Mrs. Case’s classes;
and to gain these privileges one had to stand
well in her general studies. Lily was smart
enough, was a quick student, and so kept up
her school work.
</p>
<p>
This business of acting appealed to her immensely.
She was “just crazy about it,” as
she admitted to her particular friend, Hester
Grimes.
</p>
<p>
“I wish my folks were poor, so that I would
have to work when I leave school,” she declared.
“Then I’d go on the stage myself.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t!” exclaimed Hester.
</p>
<p>
“I would in a minute. And this Signor Pizotti
could place me very advantageously——”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! you don’t believe anything that fellow
says, do you?” demanded her chum, who
was eminently practical and had none of the silly
ideas in her head that troubled Lily.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know him!” exclaimed Lily.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t want to,” replied Hester, gruffly.
</p>
<p>
Preparations for the first dress rehearsal of
“The Spring Road” went on apace. But, of
course, Bobby Hargrew <em>would</em> have bad luck!
She was thrown from Short and Long’s bobsled
one night and had to be helped home. The hurt
to her foot was a small matter; but the doctor
said she would have to wear her arm in a sling
for a time.
</p>
<p>
“And how can I play <em>Arista</em> with my arm
strapped to my side?” wailed Bobby, when Jess
and Laura came in to commiserate with her over
the accident. “Oh, dear me! I am the most
unlucky person in the world. If it was raining
soup I’d have a hole in <em>my</em> dipper!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Monterey, the local manager, came himself
to the dress rehearsal. He only sat out
front, and watched and listened; and he went
away without expressing an opinion to anybody.
Yet Jess saw him there and was excited by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
possibility of Mr. Monterey’s recognizing the
value of the play for professional purposes.
</p>
<p>
At the Morse domicile things were going better,
and the girl’s mind was vastly relieved from
present troubles. Yet she was wise enough to
see that in the offing the same danger of debt
threatened them if they were not very, very
careful.
</p>
<p>
It was true that scarcely half the prize money
had been spent; yet Mrs. Morse’s regular work
on the <em>Courier</em> barely fed them; and her success
with the popular magazines was but fitful.
Sometimes two months passed without her
mother receiving even a ten-dollar check from
her fugitive work.
</p>
<p>
Oh, if she could only find somebody who
would take the play—after the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’s had
made use of it—and whip it into shape for professional
use, and give her a part of the proceeds!
</p>
<p>
That was the thought continually knocking at
the door of Jess Morse’s mind. It was “too
good to be true,” yet she kept thinking about it,
and hoping for the impossible, and dreaming of
it.
</p>
<p>
However, the dress rehearsal of “The Spring
Road” was pronounced by the teachers and Mr.
Pizotti as eminently satisfactory. Bobby was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
letter-perfect in her part, if she <em>did</em> have
“a damaged wing,” as she said. And most of the
other important roles were well learned.
</p>
<p>
The very prettiest girl of Central High had
been chosen for the chief female character, and
in this case prettiness went with brains. She had
learned her part, and was natural and graceful,
and was altogether a delight.
</p>
<p>
As for Launcelot Darby, he was the most romantic
looking <em>Truant Lover</em> that could have
been found. And he played with feeling, too,
although his mates were making a whole lot of
fun of him on the side. But Laura had urged
him to do his best, and Lance would have done
anything in his power to please Mother Wit.
</p>
<p>
Chet Belding, as a peasant, “made up” well,
and was letter perfect, too, in his part, if a little
awkward. But that did not so much matter,
considering the character he had to portray.
And, of course, he would do nothing to belittle
Jess’s play. His whole heart was in his work,
too.
</p>
<p>
So, after that first dress rehearsal, the committee
and Jess were hopeful of success. The
time for the production of the play was set, the
tickets printed, and out of school hours everything
was in a bustle of preparation for the great
occasion.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—“MR. PIZOTTI”</h2>
<p>
“Listen to this!”
</p>
<p>
Bobby Hargrew, her arm still in a sling, seized
Jess Morse by the wrist and “tiptoed” along the
corridor of the second wing of Central High,
where the small offices were located, and with
tragic expression pointed to a certain door that
stood ajar.
</p>
<p>
Jess, amazed, did not speak, but listened. Out
of the room came a muffled voice, but the words
spoken were these:
</p>
<p>
“Unhand me! Nay, keep your distance,
Count Mornay! I am no peasant wench to be
charmed either by your gay coat or your gay
manner. Ah! your villainies are known to me,
nor can you hide the cloven hoof beneath the
edge of Virtue’s robe.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha! ha!” chuckled Bobby, almost strangling
with laughter. “He ought to have worn boots
and so hidden his ‘cloven hoof.’ Come away,
Jess, or I shall burst! Did you ever hear the
like?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, what is it?” demanded Jess,
mystified.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t! Wait till I laugh!” chuckled
Bobby, when they were around the corner of the
corridor again. “Isn’t that rich?”
</p>
<p>
“Who was it talking?” asked Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Talking! Didn’t you recognize that oration?”
</p>
<p>
“I did not. Mother doesn’t allow me to read
any penny-dreadful story papers, magazines or
books.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ho! Wait!” gasped Bobby. “That’s
Lil.”
</p>
<p>
“Lily Pendleton?”
</p>
<p>
“You evidently haven’t heard any of the
‘Duchess of Dusenberry’ before. <em>That’s it!</em>”
</p>
<p>
“Not part of her play?”
</p>
<p>
“That is one of the melodramatic bits,” said
Bobby, weakly, leaning against the wall for support.
“Yes, really, Jess. That is in her play.
I’ve heard her recite it before.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me!” gasped Jess.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not <em>all</em> so bad, I guess. But when she
gets flowery and romantic she just tears off such
paragraphs as that. ‘Nor can you hide the cloven
hoof beneath the edge of Virtue’s robe.’ Isn’t
that a peach?”
</p>
<p>
“Bobby!” exclaimed Jess, breathless herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
by now, “you use the worst slang of any girl
in Central High.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. But Lil’s using worse language
than I ever dreamed of,” laughed Bobby.
“I’ve heard her spouting that sort of stuff time
and time again. When she shuts herself up, presumably
to study her part in your play, half the
time she is reciting her own lines. She likes the
sound of ’em. And she had that Pizotti fellow
backed in a corner of the front hall at the M.
O. R. house the other afternoon, reciting that
same sort of stuff to him.
</p>
<p>
“Repeating her play?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep. The silly! And he pretending that it
was great, and applauding her. I’ll wager that
he sees a way to make money out of Lil Pendleton,
or he wouldn’t stand for it.”
</p>
<p>
Jess carried this idea in her mind, although
she was not as much troubled by her schoolmate’s
foolishness as was Mother Wit. There was a
loyalty among the girls of Central High, however,
that few ignored. Despite the fact that
Jess had never especially liked Lily Pendleton,
she would have done anything in her power to
help her.
</p>
<p>
So, that very evening, when she was marketing,
she chanced to see something that brought
Lil’s affairs into her mind again. She was going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
into Mr. Vandergriff’s store when she saw a
man, bundled in a big ulster, talking with the
proprietor.
</p>
<p>
Griff came forward to wait on Jess, and the
girl might not have noticed the man by the desk
a second time had she not overheard Mr. Vandergriff
say:
</p>
<p>
“You take advantage of my good nature,
Abel. Because I knew you in the old country,
you come here and plead poverty. I can’t see
your family suffer, for your wife is a nice
woman, if you <em>are</em> a rascal!”
</p>
<p>
“Hard words! Hard words, Vandergriff,”
muttered the other.
</p>
<p>
Jess saw that he was a little man, and the high
ulster collar muffled the lower part of his face.
But as he turned toward the door she caught a
glimpse of a glossy black mustache, and two
beady black eyes.
</p>
<p>
It was Mr. Pizotti!
</p>
<p>
The girl was so astonished, for the man was
shabbily dressed, and shuffled out with several
bundles under his arm, that she could scarcely
remember what else she wanted to buy when
Griff asked her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I say, Griff!” she demanded, breathlessly,
and in a whisper. “Who was that man
who just went out?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why—oh, that was only Abel Plornish.”
</p>
<p>
“Abel Plornish!”
</p>
<p>
“Yep. Poor, useless creature,” said the boy,
with disgust. “Or, so father says. He knew
Abel in England. You know, father came from
London before he was married,” and Griff
smiled.
</p>
<p>
“But this man—are you sure his name is
Plornish?”
</p>
<p>
“Quite, Jess. Why, he plays the violin, or
the piano, in some cheap moving picture place,
I believe.”
</p>
<p>
“Then he is a musician?” demanded Jess,
breathlessly.
</p>
<p>
“And a bad one, I reckon. But he has done
other things. He’s been on the stage. And he’s
even worked in the Centerport Opera House, I
believe.”
</p>
<p>
“And that is really his name?” asked Jess.
</p>
<p>
“It’s an awful one, isn’t it? Plornish!
Nothing very romantic or fancy about that,”
laughed Griff. “Now, what else, Jess?”
</p>
<p>
Jess was so disturbed by this discovery that
she could only think to ask Griff one more question.
That related to where Plornish lived.
</p>
<p>
“Somewhere on Governor Street. I think it’s
Number 9. Tenement house. Oh, they’re poor,
and I believe when he gets any money he spends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
it on himself. I saw him once on Market Street
dressed like a dandy. But when his wife and
children come in here they look pretty shabby.”
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t very late, and, anyway, Jess couldn’t
have slept that night without talking the matter
over with Mother Wit. She left her basket in
the kitchen, saw that her mother was busy at
her desk, and ran up Whiffle Street hill to the
Belding house.
</p>
<p>
“Is dat suah yo’, Miss Jess?” asked Mammy
Jinny, peering out of the side door when Jess
rang the bell. “Come right erlong in, honey.
Yo’s jes’ as welcome as de flowers in de Maytime.
B-r-r! ain’t it cold?”
</p>
<p>
“It is cold, Mammy,” said Jess to the Beldings’
old serving woman. “Where’s Laura?”
</p>
<p>
“She’s done gone up to her room ter listen ter
Mars’ Chet an’ dat Lance Darby boy orate dem
pieces dey is goin’ to recite in school nex’ week.”
</p>
<p>
“They are going to act in my play, Mammy!”
cried Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe so. Mebbe so. But it’s all recitationin’
ter me. Dat leetle Bobby Hargrew was
in here and she say it’s jes’ like w’en you-all
useter recite at de Sunday night concerts in de
Sunday school room. An’ dem pieces yo’ orated
den was a hull lot nicer dan w’at Mars’ Chet is
sayin’. ’Member how you recited dat ‘Leetle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
drops o’ water, leetle grains o’ sand’ piece,
Miss Jess? Dat was suah a nice piece o’
po’try.”
</p>
<p>
“And you don’t care for the parts you have
heard of my play, Mammy?” asked Jess, much
amused.
</p>
<p>
“Suah ’nuff, now! Did you make up disher
play dey is goin’ ter act?” demanded Mammy
Jinny.
</p>
<p>
“I certainly did.”
</p>
<p>
“Wal, I hates ter hu’t yo’ feelin’s, Miss Jess,”
said Mammy, gravely, “but dat ‘Leetle drops o’
water’ po’try was a hull lot better—ter <em>my</em> min’!
Ya’as’m! yo kin’ go right up. Yo’ll hear dem-all
a-spoutin’—spoutin’ jes’ like whales!”
</p>
<p>
And so she did. Chet was reading his lines
with much unction while striding up and down
Laura’s pretty little room. Lance and Mother
Wit were his audience.
</p>
<p>
“For goodness sake, Chet!” cried Jess,
breaking in. “Who told you your part was
tragic, and that ‘The Spring Road’ was tragedy?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” questioned Chet, stopping short and
blinking at her.
</p>
<p>
“Do read the lines naturally. Don’t be ‘orating,’
as Mammy Jinny calls it. I guess she’s
right. ‘Little drops of water’ is better than all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
that bombastic stuff. Do, do, my dear, speak
it naturally.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear her!” growled Chet “And she wrote
it!”
</p>
<p>
“I never really meant it to sound like that,
Chet,” declared Jess, shaking her head. “I
really didn’t. Why! it sounds almost as bad
as ‘The Duchess of Dawnleigh.’”
</p>
<p>
“Wha—what’s that?” demanded Lance.
</p>
<p>
“Not Lil’s play?” cried Laura. “Have you
heard it?”
</p>
<p>
Jess told what she had heard at the door of
the recitation room that afternoon, and they
laughed over it.
</p>
<p>
“Yet I can see very well,” continued Jess,
“that you actors can make my words sound just
as absurd if you want to. Do, <em>do</em> be natural.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I tell them,” sighed Laura. “I
am glad you heard Chet spouting here. One
would think he was playing ‘Hamlet,’ or ‘Richard
III.’”
</p>
<p>
Chet was a little miffed. But he soon “came
out of it,” as Lance said, and he was so fond of
Jess anyway that he would have tried his best
to please her.
</p>
<p>
He grew more moderate in his “orating” and
the girls, as critics, were better pleased. Lance
took a leaf out of his chum’s book, too, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
when he declaimed his lines he succeeded in
pleasing Jess and Laura the first time. Besides,
Lance was naturally a better actor than Chet.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pizotti had taught them how to enter
properly, and how to take their cues; but to
Jess’s mind he was not the man to train amateurs
to speak their parts with naturalness. If
Miss Gould had not given so much time to the
rehearsals of “The Spring Road” the play
would have not been half the success it promised
to be. And, of course, the Central High
teacher gave her attention mainly to the girls
in the cast of characters.
</p>
<p>
When Lance and Chet lounged off to the
latter’s den Jess instantly poured into Laura’s
ears her discovery of the identity of “Mr.
Pizotti.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, even at that he may be a man trying
to earn his living. Many stage people change
their names for business reasons. ‘Plornish’
is not an attractive name, you must admit,” said
Laura, smiling. “‘Pizotti’ fits his foreign
look.”
</p>
<p>
“But what is he trying to get out of Lil
Pendleton?” demanded Jess, bluntly.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what troubles me,” admitted Mother
Wit. “I believe he is trying to get money out
of Lily, or from her folks. And it has to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
with Lil’s play. You can see that she believes
her play was slighted and that it is a great deal
better than yours, Jess.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess she has a good opinion of it,” returned
Jess, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Well, suppose this fellow tells her she is
right, and that he can get it produced, if she
will put up the money?” suggested Mother Wit.
“I—I wish Lil would place confidence in me.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell her mother.”
</p>
<p>
“No use,” sighed Laura. “I doubt if she
would even listen to me. She wouldn’t want
to be bothered. You know very well the kind
of woman Mrs. Pendleton is.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t suppose it is any of our business,
anyway,” spoke Jess.
</p>
<p>
“It is. Lil is one of us—one of the girls of
Central High. We have a deep interest in anything
that concerns her. The only trouble is,”
sighed Laura, “I don’t know just what is best
to do.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—MOTHER WIT PUTS TWO AND TWO TOGETHER</h2>
<p>
The snow still mantled the ground, and the
coasting and ski running remained very popular
sports with the girls and boys of Central High.
But a day’s hard rain, with a sharp frost after
it, had given the iceboating another lease of
life, too. Lake Luna was a-glare from the mainland
to Cavern Island, and the freight boats had
given over running until the spring break-up.
</p>
<p>
Not that there were no open places in the
ice—for there were, and dangerous holes, too.
The current through the length of the lake was
bound to make the ice weak in places. But near
the Centerport shore was a long stretch of open
ice that the authorities pronounced safe.
</p>
<p>
Chet and Lance got the <em>Blue Streak</em> out again
and there wasn’t a girl in the junior class who
was not envious of Laura and Jess. Skating
was tame beside traveling at a mile a minute in
an aero-iceboat; and the other ice yachts were
not in the same class with the invention of Chet
and Lance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
The date set for the production of Jess’s play
in the big hall of the schoolhouse approached,
however; and preparation for the event was
neglected by none of the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’s or the
other girls and boys in the cast.
</p>
<p>
Friday evening would see the first production;
but the intention was to give a matinee for the
pupils of the three Centerport High Schools at
a nominal price on Saturday morning, and then
a final performance Saturday evening. From
these three performances the committee hoped
to gain at least a thousand dollars, and possibly
half as much more. This would be a splendid
addition to the somewhat slim building fund of
the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’s.
</p>
<p>
Lily Pendleton went about these days with a
very self-satisfied expression of countenance
and such a mysterious manner that Bobby said
to her:
</p>
<p>
“Huh! you look like an old hen that’s hidden
her nest and thinks nobody’s going to find it,
What are you up to now?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you wish you knew?” returned Lily.
</p>
<p>
Even Hester Grimes admitted that she was not
in Lil’s confidence. But the hints Lily dropped
troubled Mother Wit.
</p>
<p>
Laura Belding had not forgotten the discovery
her chum had made regarding the identity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
of the man who called himself “Pizotti.” The
stage director would not again attend the performance
of “The Spring Road” until the day
of the first production. Yet Laura believed that
Lily had an understanding of some sort with
him.
</p>
<p>
Governor Street, where Griff told Jess the
Plornish family lived, was one of the very
poorest in that part of the city, being located
at the foot of the Hill and below Market Street
itself.
</p>
<p>
Laura and Jess went shopping one afternoon
on Market Street; and despite the fact that it
was nipping cold weather, and that the street
was a mass of snow-ice, save on the car tracks,
they walked home. The sidewalks were slippery,
and it took some caution to keep one’s
feet; but the chums were so sure of their balance
that they stepped along quite briskly.
</p>
<p>
From Mr. Vandergriff’s store they saw a
poorly dressed little girl—perhaps eight years
old, or so—dragging a soap box on runners.
The box had several packages of groceries in it,
besides a bottle of milk.
</p>
<p>
Just as the child started across Market Street
there came a heavy sleigh with plumes, great
robes, a pair of dapple gray horses, and a great
jingling of bells. The driver did not see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
little girl with her box until it was almost too
late to pull out.
</p>
<p>
It all happened in a flash! The peril was upon
the child before she or anybody else realized it;
and it had passed her, only smashing her sled
and spilling her goods, in another moment.
</p>
<p>
The sleigh, with the horses prancing, swept
on and did not even stop for its occupants to
note the damage it had done. The child was
left crying in the gutter, with the groceries scattered
about and the milk making a white river
upon the dirty ice.
</p>
<p>
Laura sprang to aid the little one in picking
up her goods; but Jess exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Did you see that, Laura?”
</p>
<p>
“I should think I did! And they never
stopped.”
</p>
<p>
“But did you see who was in the sleigh?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“It was Lil—and that man was riding with
her again.”
</p>
<p>
“Pizotti?” gasped Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Here! give me that bottle. I’ll run
across and get another bottle of milk from Mr.
Vandergriff. We’ll have to help the little one
carry her stuff home. The little sled is smashed
to smithereens.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, Jess. Now, don’t cry, child!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
exclaimed Mother Wit, kindly, hovering over the
little girl. “You won’t be blamed for this, I
know.”
</p>
<p>
But the child was staring after the sleigh instead
of picking up her goods, and with such a
wondering look on her face that Laura asked:
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with you? What did
you see?”
</p>
<p>
The child still remained dumb, and Laura took
her by the shoulder and shook her a little.
</p>
<p>
“What is your name?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Maggie,” said the little one, gulping down
a sob.
</p>
<p>
“Maggie what?”
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am; Maggie Plornish,” stammered
the other.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me!” gasped Laura. “Did
you see the man in that sleigh?”
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am! No ma’am!” cried the little
girl, in great haste, and shaking her head violently.
“There warn’t no man in the sleigh.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes there was, child.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t see no man,” declared Maggie, energetically.
“It was the lady I seen.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know her?” asked Laura, slowly,
convinced that the child was deceiving her—or,
at least, attempting to do so.
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am. I never seed her before.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
It was evidently useless to try to get anything
more out of the child on that tack. But Laura
was sure that there could not be two Plornish
families in Centerport, and if Jess had seen the
stage director in Lily Pendleton’s sleigh, it was
plain that Maggie had seen him, too. And she
had recognized him.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you live, little girl?” asked Laura,
quietly, as she saw Jess returning with a fresh
bottle of milk.
</p>
<p>
“Over ’ere on Governor Street. Number
ninety-three, Miss.”
</p>
<p>
“Lead the way, then,” said Laura, promptly.
“We’ll help you carry your things home and
explain to mamma how you came to get them
scattered. You surely have a mamma, haven’t
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am. And there’s a new baby.
That’s who the milk’s for.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! how many of you Plornish children
are there?” asked Jess, to whom Laura had
immediately whispered the intelligence that this
child was evidently one of Mr. Pizotti’s progeny.
</p>
<p>
“Seven, ma’am. But some’s older’n me and
they’re workin’.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you go to school?” asked Laura.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t—not right now. We ain’t got good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
shoes to go ’round—nor petticoats. And then,
the baby didn’t come along until a month ago and
he has to be ’tended some while mamma washes
and cleans up around.”
</p>
<p>
Laura looked at Jess meaningly and asked:
</p>
<p>
“Where’s your papa?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! he’s home,” said the child, immediately
losing her smart manner of speaking.
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t he work?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am. Sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s his trade?” asked Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Huh?”
</p>
<p>
Maggie Plornish had suddenly become very
dull indeed!
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t your father work regularly?” explained
Laura, kindly. “Hasn’t he any particular
work?”
</p>
<p>
Maggie considered this thoughtfully. Then
she shook her head and with gravity replied:
“I guess he’s an outa.”
</p>
<p>
“A what?” gasped Jess.
</p>
<p>
“An outa, Miss.”
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun’s an ‘outa’?” demanded
Jess, looking at Laura.
</p>
<p>
But Mother Wit understood and smiled.
“You mean he’s ’most always out of work?”
she asked.
</p>
<p>
Maggie Plornish nodded vigorously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am! He’s us’lly outa work. Most
reg’larly. Yes, ma’am!”
</p>
<p>
“Well for mercy’s sake!” gasped Jess, gazing
at her chum in wonder. “Can you beat
<em>that?</em> If this is the same family——”
</p>
<p>
Laura stayed her with a look. “We’ll see,”
said Mother Wit. “Lead on, Maggie. We’ll
see your mother, anyway.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—MRS. PLORNISH</h2>
<p>
Governor Street was just as dirty and
squalid as any other tenement-house street in
the poorer section of a middle-class city. The
street-cleaning department had given up all hope
before they reached Governor Street, and the
middle of the way was a series of ridges and
mountains of heaped-up, dirty, frozen snow.
</p>
<p>
The snow had been cleaned from the sidewalks,
and the gutters freed so that the melting
ice could run off by way of the sewers when
the sun was kind; but the way to Number 93
was not a pleasant one to travel.
</p>
<p>
However, Laura and Jess, with little Maggie,
reached the door in question in a few minutes,
A puff of steamy air—the essence of countless
washings—met the girls as the lower door was
pushed open. That is the only way the long
and barren halls were heated—by the steam from
the wash-boilers. For Number 93 Governor
Street was one of those tenement houses which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
seem always to be in a state of being washed,
and laundered, and cleaned up; yet which never
show many traces of cleanliness, after all.
</p>
<p>
“We live on the top floor,” said Maggie, volunteering
her first remark since starting homeward.
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t scare us,” said Laura, cheerfully.
“Lead on, MacDuff!”
</p>
<p>
“No. My name’s Plornish,” said this very
literal—and seemingly dull—little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, Maggie MacDuff Plornish!”
laughed Mother Wit. “We follow you.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl toiled up the stairs like an old
woman. Laura and Jess caught glimpses of
other tenements as they followed the child and
saw that there was real poverty here. Jess began
to compare her situation with that of these
humble folk, and saw that she had much to
be grateful for.
</p>
<p>
She was troubled over the lack of a new
party dress, perhaps, or because there were times
when she and her mother were pinched for
money. But the bare floors and uncurtained
windows of these “flats,” with the poor furniture
and raggedly clothed children, spelled a
degree of poverty deeper than Jess Morse had
imagined before.
</p>
<p>
A sallow woman met them at the door of one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
of the top-floor flats. She was as faded as her
calico dress. Her arms were lean and her hands
wrinkled, and all the flesh about her finger nails
was swollen and of a livid hue, from being so
much in hot water.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, two steaming tubs stood in the
kitchen into which the girls of Central High
were ushered. A big wash was evidently under
way, and Mrs. Plornish wiped her arms and
hands from the suds, as she invited the girls in,
staring in amazement at one and another meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
“Your little Maggie met with an accident,
Mrs. Plornish,” said Laura, pleasantly, putting
the packages she had carried upon the table.
“And so we helped her home with her groceries.”
</p>
<p>
“And Mr. Vandergriff says never mind the
bottle of milk that was spilled,” explained Jess,
setting the second bottle on the table.
</p>
<p>
“You come from Mr. Vandergriff?” asked
the woman, her faded cheek coloring a trifle.
</p>
<p>
Laura explained more fully. Mrs. Plornish
seemed to have had her motherly instincts pretty
well quenched by time and poverty.
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m. I expect Maggie’ll git runned over
and killed some day on that there Market
Street,” she complained. “But I ain’t got nobody else
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
to send. Bob and Betty, and Charlemagne,
air either at school or to work——”
</p>
<p>
“Where is your husband?” asked Laura,
briskly. “Is he working?”
</p>
<p>
“Off an’ on,” said the woman, but looking at
the visitors a little doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Engaged just at present?” pursued Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Miss,” said Mrs. Plornish, “air
you charity visitors? Though you <em>be</em> young.”
</p>
<p>
“We have nothing to do with charities,”
Laura said. “We just came to help Maggie.
I didn’t know but I might know of something
for your husband to do if he is out of work.”
</p>
<p>
“He ain’t. He’s got a job right now. And
I guess it will turn out to be a good one,” spoke
Mrs. Plornish, and she smiled with sudden satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“It seems to please you, Mrs. Plornish,” said
Jess, quickly. “I hope you will not be disappointed.
Where is he working?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, this job o’ work is goin’ to take him out
o’ town for a while,” returned the woman, doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed? To Lumberport?” asked the insistent
Jess.
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“To Keyport, then?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell you. It—it’s a secret—that is,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
it’s sort of a private affair. Abel is a very
smart man in his way—and this—er—this job
will bring him considerable money, I expect. I
hope we’ll all be better off soon.”
</p>
<p>
She seemed excited by the prospect of her
husband’s secret employment, yet she was doubtful,
too. Laura and Jess looked at each other
and they both came to the same conclusion. If
Abel Plornish, alias “Mr. Pizotti,” was scheming
to get some money from the Pendletons,
Mrs. Plornish knew at least a little something
about it.
</p>
<p>
But Laura did not know how to get this information
from the woman; nor did the girl
believe that it was really right for her to do so.
But Mother Wit thought it would do no harm to
help the family if she could do so without offending.
She drew forth her purse and looked
gently at Mrs. Plornish.
</p>
<p>
“You won’t mind if I give you something to
spend on Maggie?” asked Mother Wit, in her
most winning way. “Do let me help her, Mrs.
Plornish! I really mean no offense.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, you look an honest enough young
lady,” said the woman.
</p>
<p>
“Maggie says she needs shoes so that she can
go to school. Don’t you think you can spare
her for at least a part of the time?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe I’d better, Miss. The truant officer’s
been around once,” said Mrs. Plornish. “But
the baby’s so small——”
</p>
<p>
“If your husband is as successful as you
think he’ll be,” interposed Jess, sharply, “you’ll
be able to afford to let her go, eh? Then
you will not have to work so hard yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, Miss!” cried Mrs. Plornish,
briskly.
</p>
<p>
Laura put the money for Maggie’s shoes into
her hand. “I hope we may come and see
Maggie again?” she said, pinching the thin
cheek of the little girl, who had been staring at
them all this time, without winking, and without
a word.
</p>
<p>
“Sure you can, Miss! And thank you. Thank
the young lady, Maggie,” ordered Mrs. Plornish.
</p>
<p>
Maggie gave a funny, bobbing little courtesy
as the older girls went out. Laura and Jess said
nothing to each other until they reached the
street. Then the latter declared:
</p>
<p>
“She knows something about it.”
</p>
<p>
“About what?” asked Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Whatever it is that’s going on. Whatever
it is ‘Pizotti’ is doing.”
</p>
<p>
“And we know he is staging your play for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’s,” said Laura, quietly. “That’s
all we <em>do</em> know at present.”
</p>
<p>
“But there’s something else.”
</p>
<p>
“That we don’t know. I wish we did.”
</p>
<p>
“And he’s going out of town!”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps that is not so,” returned Laura,
thoughtfully. “Of course his wife knows that
he works under an assumed name. That is no
crime, of course——”
</p>
<p>
“But there’s something odd about it all,”
cried Jess.
</p>
<p>
“All right. How are we going to find out?
Lil won’t tell us——”
</p>
<p>
“And it is her business—or her mother’s,”
said Jess. “And that’s a fact.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s one of us—she’s a Central High girl,”
repeated Laura. “If we can save her from
the result of her own awful folly, we should do
so.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! And we don’t know what she’s to be
saved from as yet!” cried Jess, which ended the
discussion for the time being.
</p>
<p>
But that evening Bobby Hargrew hailed Jess
in her father’s store.
</p>
<p>
“Say, Eminent Author! what do you know
about <em>this?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“About what, Bobby?” returned Jess.
</p>
<p>
Bobby was unfurling some sort of a folded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
paper which she had drawn from that inexhaustible
pocket of hers.
</p>
<p>
“See! it’s a show bill. My cousin, Ed Pembroke,
sent it to me from Keyport. He says the
town is plastered with them. Does it remind
you of anything?” and she began to read in a
loud voice:
</p>
<p>
“‘Coming! Coming! Coming! North Street Orpheum——’ same date as your show
here on Friday night, Jess.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said Jess, peering over her shoulder
as Bobby unctuously read on:
</p>
<p>
“‘High Class Entertainment for High Class
people!’ Ha! that’s good,” sniffed Bobby.
“‘The Lady of the Castle’ played by a capable
cast of professional Thespians, who will assist
the Talented Young Amateur, GREBA PENDENNIS.
‘Her portrayal of the <em>Duchess</em> is a
Work of Art.’ Wow, wow! Listen to that
now!” cried Bobby, in great delight. “Wouldn’t
you think that was Lil Pendleton?”
</p>
<p>
Jess stared at the bill, and whispered: “I
would indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“But of course it isn’t!” gasped Bobby, looking
at Jess, in sudden curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“What is Lil’s middle name?” demanded
Jess, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“Why—I—— Ah! she <em>has</em> got a middle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
name, hasn’t she? She signs it ‘Lillian G. Pendleton!’”
</p>
<p>
“That is it,” said Jess.
</p>
<p>
“But of course this can’t be Lil?” cried
Bobby, aghast. “‘The Lady of the Castle’
might be another name for ‘The Duchess of
Doosenberry’; though. What do you think,
Jess?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to think,” said Jess.
“But you give me that bill, Bobby, and I’ll show
it to Mother Wit.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—“CAUGHT ON THE FLY”</h2>
<p>
The last few days before the first performance
of “The Spring Road” was a whirl of excitement
for most of the girls of Central High,
and all those belonging to the M.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;R.’s. or who
were to take part in the play. Mr. Sharp, on his
own responsibility, announced a general holiday
for Friday, with certain lessons to be made up
to pay for the deducted time.
</p>
<p>
“It is my opinion that little work can be expected
from either the young ladies or young
gentlemen on the momentous day,” he said.
“Besides, I understand that Miss Gould desires
to have a final rehearsal of the play on Friday
morning on the stage upstairs. Therefore, mere
matters of education may be put aside.”
</p>
<p>
He was quite good natured about it, however,
and entirely approved of the attempt of Central
High pupils to do something upon the stage that
was really “worth while.” And Jess Morse’s
play was indeed far above the average of amateur
attempts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
“You girls are invited to a dash on the <em>Blue
Streak</em> after the rehearsal to-morrow, Sis,” Chet
Belding said to Laura at dinner Thursday evening.
“Lance and I will show you some sport.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Belding looked doubtfully at her husband.
“Do you think that iceboat Chet has
built is really safe for the girls, James?” she
asked.
</p>
<p>
“Bless your heart, Mother!” returned the
jeweler, his eyes twinkling, “it’s quite as safe
for Laura and Jess as it is for the boys.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye—es, I suppose so,” admitted the good
woman. “But it doesn’t <em>seem</em> so safe. Girls
are different from boys.”
</p>
<p>
“Not so different, nowadays,” grumbled
Chet. “You ought to see some of those husky
Central High girls going off with Mrs. Case
on their skis. And ski running is as dangerous
as iceboating—believe me!”
</p>
<p>
“I <em>do</em> believe you, my son. I have no reason
to doubt your word,” returned Mother Belding,
quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mum! that’s only an expression——”
</p>
<p>
“Please stick to English—and facts, Chetwood,”
advised his mother.
</p>
<p>
“I declare!” grumpily remarked her son. “A
meal of victuals at this house has got to be just
like attending one of Old Dimple’s lectures.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“Chet!” spoke his father, sternly.
</p>
<p>
“Well! I guess I didn’t mean it just that
way—not the way it sounded,” the boy said
hastily. “But mother <em>does</em> pick a fellow up
so——”
</p>
<p>
“I have been doing that all your life, my
son,” said his mother. “Whenever you stub
your toe, mother has been there to comfort
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Got you there, Chet,” laughed Laura. “And
you used to be a terrible ‘stumble heels,’
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! you’re all down on me,” declared her
brother, but in a milder tone. “I reckon I’m
not so popular in this house as I thought I was.
But that isn’t the answer to my question, Laura.
Do you and Jess want to fly with us to-morrow
just after lunch?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course we do,” replied his sister. “I
don’t suppose mother has any real objection?”
</p>
<p>
“My objections to your sports and athletics
seem to have very little reality about them, children,”
said Mrs. Belding. “Even my husband
will not give me backing.”
</p>
<p>
“When I see Chet and Laura anemic, or
otherwise sickly, as the result of their out-of-door
sports or gym. work, you will find me up in
arms with you against such activities, Mother,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
declared Mr. Belding, jovially. “I’d a good
deal rather have little Mother Wit here half a
Tom-boy——”
</p>
<p>
“Which I’m not, I hope, Papa Belding!”
cried Laura, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“I should hope not,” said her mother.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” laughed Mr. Belding. “But I
would rather you were than like a few of the
girls who attend your school. Some of them
are growing up to womanhood too quickly to
suit me. There’s that Pendleton girl——”
</p>
<p>
“What do you know about Lily Pendleton,
Father?” asked Laura, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, she dresses like a girl of twenty-five—and
acts that grown up, too,” observed the
jeweler. “She was in the store a week or so
ago. Now! there’s another bad thing. Her
mother lets her do just about as she pleases, I
guess.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Pendleton has always been very lenient
with Lillian,” agreed his wife.
</p>
<p>
“The girl brought into my store a jewel box
in which were things valued at more than a thousand
dollars, I believe. Old-fashioned jewels
left her by her grandmother. She thought of
having some re-set And she really wanted me
to buy some of them. She said her mother
wouldn’t care what she did with them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course, James, you did not give the girl
money?” exclaimed Mrs. Belding.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I did not! I am not a pawnbroker.
But I valued the stones for her, and
she took them away. I wonder what she really
meant by trying to sell them?”
</p>
<p>
Laura listened and flushed; but she remained
silent. Since her visit to the Plornish tenement,
and since she had read the playbill from Keyport
that Jess had brought her, Laura had been very
gravely exercised in her mind regarding Lily
Pendleton. But she could not bring herself to
the point of taking either her father or mother
into her confidence. It was not her own secret;
it was Lily’s.
</p>
<p>
The following morning the rehearsal of “The
Spring Road” went with a snap and vim that
delighted everybody. Miss Gould could not
praise the girls and boys too highly. Even Mr.
Pizotti signified his satisfaction with the way in
which the play proceeded. Really, the actual
production of the piece would go on well without
his presence, although the sum they had
agreed to pay the stage manager covered the
three performances of the play already arranged
for.
</p>
<p>
Laura and Jess went down to the lake after
luncheon to meet the two boys. The <em>Blue</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
<em>Streak</em>, fresh in a new coat of paint, and with
every part of the mechanism guaranteed in perfect
order, was already hauled out upon the ice.
</p>
<p>
The surface of the lake was not as it had been
when the girls had taken their first ride on the
aero-iceboat. Then the ice was like glass; but
now it was pebbly, broken in spots, and not a
little “hummocky.” There was a stiff wind
blowing, too, and this broke up the thinner ice
around the water-holes. The course for sleighs
and for iceboats was fairly safe, however, all
the way to Keyport.
</p>
<p>
“Say! we just saw Lily going driving with
that sleek little foreigner,” said Lance, as the
two girls appeared. “I should think Mrs. Pendleton
would send a chaperone with her daughter.
Old Mike, the coachman, is right under the
girl’s thumb.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, Lance?” asked Laura,
quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Lil Pendleton and the stage manager
are out there in the Pendletons’ sleigh. They’re
aiming for Keyport. And Lil has a big box in
the sleigh. Guess they are taking lunch along.”
</p>
<p>
“Lunch!” ejaculated Chet. “Why, that yellow
box would hold enough for an army.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! A yellow box?” cried
Jess. “Was it that box in which Lil has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
bringing her costumes to and from the rehearsals?”
</p>
<p>
“Dunno,” said Chet, not much interested.
</p>
<p>
But Jess turned to her chum, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“You know, Laura, she insisted in packing
the dresses all into that box again this noon and
taking them home with her as usual, although
every other girl left her costume in the dressing-rooms.
Did you notice it?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Laura, slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she doesn’t expect to get back until
it’s time to go on for the evening performance,”
suggested Lance.
</p>
<p>
“That’s not it,” returned Laura, quietly.
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose that girl has got in
her mind, Laura?” demanded Jess, as the boys
were making the final preparations for their
start.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know. But I believe she is the
‘talented young amateur’ advertised to appear
at the Keyport Orpheum to-night,” said Laura,
gravely.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean it!” gasped Jess. Then
she added, with sudden excitement:
</p>
<p>
“Why, she’ll spoil my play!”
</p>
<p>
“If she is not here to play her part she will
certainly interfere sadly with the success of ‘The
Spring Road,’” admitted Laura.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh! That mean, mean thing!” cried
Jess, under her breath.
</p>
<p>
“She is taking her costumes to wear in the
production of her own play, which she has renamed
‘The Lady of the Castle,’” said Laura.
“She will make a lovely ‘Duchess of Doosenberry,’
as Bobby nicknamed it, in those robes,
Jess.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Laura, I believe you are not sympathetic,”
cried Jess.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you be afraid, dear. Miss Lily will
not appear as ‘the talented young amateur, Greba
Pendennis,’ if that is what she really intends to
attempt. I have fixed that.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” demanded Jess. But
just then the boys shouted to them and they had
to hurry to take their places in the iceboat
</p>
<p>
“Chet,” said Laura, to her brother, as she
settled herself aboard, “run down near the Pendleton
sleigh if you can. I want to speak to
Lil.”
</p>
<p>
“Just as you say, Sis,” returned her brother.
“All ready? Let her go, Lance! We’ll show
these girls some traveling, eh?”
</p>
<p>
The <em>Blue Streak</em> was off in a moment and the
way she tore over the ice always gave the two
girls, at first, a feeling as though a wreck were
imminent. But in a minute or two the feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
subsided, and through the automobile goggles
they both wore they dared look ahead.
</p>
<p>
On this cold afternoon there were not many
sleighs or iceboats on the racing course between
Centerport and Keyport. But suddenly Lance
looked around, grinned through his mask, and
waved his hand toward the shore. The girls
immediately knew that he had sighted the Pendleton
sleigh.
</p>
<p>
Laura turned to look at her brother, and he
nodded at her reassuringly. Lance reduced the
speed, and the <em>Blue Streak</em> began to move shoreward.
</p>
<p>
The girls could now see the sleigh plainly.
The yellow box in which Lil carried her costumes
was a splotch of color against the white
fur robes. And there was Lil herself and the
black figure of the little stage director.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Blue Streak</em> ran closer and of a sudden
the young folks aboard the iceboat saw that
something was amiss with the Pendletons’
horses. The dapple grays were fat, well fed
beasts, and the coachman was old and rheumatic.
Perhaps the appearance of another iceboat that
had just passed the sleigh had startled the horses.
</p>
<p>
However that might be, old Mike was suddenly
flung from his seat, and the horses charged
down the lake at a gallop, swinging the sleigh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
behind them at a pace that threatened to overturn
it at any moment!
</p>
<p>
The four friends on the aero-iceboat could
hear Lil scream. And up sprang the little black
figure of Pizotti, alias Plornish, and the next
moment he had leaped to the ice!
</p>
<p>
The horses tore on, and Lil was really in peril.
But Chet guided the <em>Blue Streak</em> right down to
the runaway, coming so close that Lance Darby
was able to leap into the driver’s seat from the
running iceboat.
</p>
<p>
It was a feat that called for agility and coolness;
but the boy did it bravely. The next moment
he was out on the tongue, had recovered
the trailing lines, and the dapple grays were soon
brought to an abrupt stop.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—THE GREAT NIGHT</h2>
<p>
The event had certainly come to a startling
climax. Even Lily herself, writing a dozen
“Duchess of Dawnleighs,” could not have imagined
quite so serious a situation to balk the determination
of her created heroines, as here had
arrived to balk herself!
</p>
<p>
“Well, Lil,” Laura said to her, as the girl got
out of the sleigh. “I guess you won’t run away
to-day and leave us all in a fix—and spoil Jess’s
play. What do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Laura! is poor Mike hurt?” cried the
girl, and from that moment Laura thought better
of her. For Lil showed she was not entirely
heartless. She had thought first of the old
coachman who had served her family for so
many years, and who was even then probably
helping her to get to Keyport and the expected
performance of “The Duchess of Dawnleigh,”
against his own good sense.
</p>
<p>
“Here he comes, limping,” said Laura, rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
brusquely. “He’s not dead. But how about
Plornish?”
</p>
<p>
“Plornish?” returned Lil, puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“Pizotti, then, if you prefer his stage name.”
</p>
<p>
“Is—isn’t Pizotti his name?” demanded Lil,
still struggling with her tears.
</p>
<p>
“His real name is Abel Plornish,” said Laura,
bluntly. She saw no use in “letting Lily down
easy.” “He has a wife and seven children living
down on Governor Street, in a miserable
tenement. He neglects them a good deal, I believe.
But this time, if he had made what he
expected to out of you——By the way, Lil,
what were you going to pay him?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I——For putting me on the stage with
his company?” she stammered.
</p>
<p>
“Is that the way he put it? Well, yes,” said
Laura. “It’s the same thing. He was going
to star you in your own play, was he?”
</p>
<p>
“Ye—es,” sobbed Lily. “And now it’s all
spoiled! And I was going to take all the money
I pawned grandmother’s jewels for——”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me! How much?” snapped
Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Five hundred dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“Has he got the cash?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” sobbed Lil.
</p>
<p>
“All right, then. No harm done. I went to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
Mr. Monterey and he found out that Plornish
had got together no company at all. You were
the only person who had learned a part in your
play, I guess, Lily. Ah! Chet’s got him.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Chet had stopped the aero-iceboat
and run back to the prostrate stage director.
Plornish had a broken leg and had to be lifted
by both boys into the Pendleton sleigh. Old
Michael could manage the horses again and
turned them about. Laura elected to go back to
Centerport with the injured man and the very-much-disturbed
Lily Pendleton.
</p>
<p>
“Now, just see the sort of a man this fellow
is,” said Laura, paying no attention to the groanings
of Plornish, “He was intending to get
the money from you at Keyport and then disappear.
All he spent was merely for the bills put
up advertising the show—the show which he
never intended would come off, Lil! And you
were going down there and leaving us all in the
lurch!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m sorry!” groaned Lil.
</p>
<p>
“I hope so. Sorry enough to go home and
rest and prepare to play your part in ‘The Spring
Road’ to-night,” spoke Laura, tartly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! how can I?” cried the girl.
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t,” said Laura, frankly, “I won’t
keep this affair a secret. You will be the laughing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
stock of all Central High. I am not going
to allow Jess Morse’s play to be spoiled because
of <em>you</em>. If you were so jealous and envious
that you did not want to see Jess’s play succeed,
you could have refused, at least, to be cast for an
important part in it. And now,” went on
Mother Wit, firmly, “you are going to play that
part.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Laura! you are so harsh,” sobbed Lily.
</p>
<p>
“Much that will hurt you!” sniffed Laura.
“We’ll drive around by the hospital and leave
this Plornish man. If he dares to open his
mouth, we’ll have him punished for trying to
swindle you,” and Laura looked sternly at the
black-eyed, foreign-looking fellow.
</p>
<p>
“You see, we know all about you, Mr. Plornish,
and you will have to abide by what is done
for you. Some of us will help your family while
you are helpless. But you’ve got to be good, or
even Mr. Vandergriff will forget that you and
he used to be boys together. Pah! with your
hair dye, and paint and powder, and all! Why,
you are nearly fifty years old, so Mr. Vandergriff
says, and you act and dress like a silly boy.”
</p>
<p>
Lily listened to all this, and stopped sobbing.
She began to see that there was a chance for her
to escape being a butt for her school-fellows’
jokes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can—can you keep Jess and the boys from
talking?” she whispered to Laura.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll be like oysters if I tell them to,” declared
Mother Wit.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, then, I’ll do my best,” agreed the foolish
girl. Possibly she was deeply impressed by
her escape.
</p>
<p>
Mother Wit’s plans were carried out to the letter.
Plornish was deposited at the hospital,
where he would remain for some weeks. The
performance of Jess’s play would have to get
along without him on this opening night.
</p>
<p>
And when the hour for the performance arrived,
Lily Pendleton was ready, her tears wiped
away, glorious in one of her costumes, and
“preening like a peacock”—to quote Bobby
Hargrew—before one of the long mirrors in the
dressing room.
</p>
<p>
“My, my!” laughed Bobby. “You look as
grand as the Duchess of Doosenberry, don’t you,
Lil?”
</p>
<p>
Lily looked at her rather sharply. “I’d really
like to know how much that child knows?” the
older girl murmured.
</p>
<p>
But it wasn’t what the shrewd Bobby <em>knew;</em>
it was what she <em>suspected!</em>
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—GOOD NEWS FOR JESS</h2>
<p>
Behind the scenes just before the curtain rose
upon the first act of “The Spring Road” there
was such a bustle, and running about, and whispering,
and excited signals and fragmentary talk,
that it did look, Jess said, as though matters
never would be straightened out.
</p>
<p>
Did this one know his or her part perfectly?
Was this dress right? Oh, dear! how can this
one be made to look right “from the front?”
And a thousand other doubts and queries.
</p>
<p>
No matter how many times a play is rehearsed,
it does seem just before the opening
performance as though a dozen things would
happen to spoil the effect of the first appearance.
And to the author of the play it seems as though
every person in that audience is a carping critic!
</p>
<p>
Jess peered through the peephole in the curtain
and saw that the hall was crowded.
</p>
<p>
“I just know it will be a failure!” she moaned
to her chum, Laura Belding. “It will be
laughed at. I feel it!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
“Strange how I should feel so differently!”
spoke Laura, cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! I’ll never be able to hold up my
head again if it’s not liked,” Jess pursued. “It
will just <em>kill</em> me.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t die so easy, Chum,” said Laura.
“You know we’ll need you in the big inter-school
meet after Easter.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I’ll never be fit to do anything in athletics
again!” gasped Jess.
</p>
<p>
Which was certainly not borne out by the
facts, for Jess Morse took a most important part
in the spring meet of the Girls’ Branch Athletic
League, as a perusal of the next volume of this
series: “The Girls of Central High on Track
and Field; Or, The Champions of the School
League,” will prove.
</p>
<p>
At last Miss Gould said all was ready. Really,
she did very well without the assistance of the
unpleasant, black-eyed, little Pizotti! The signal
was given and the curtain rose on the first
tableau—and it <em>was</em> a pretty sight! In this
allegorical introduction to Jess’s play there
were a score of the very prettiest girls of Central
High, and they had been dressed and were
grouped so artistically that an “Ah!” of admiration
burst from the big audience.
</p>
<p>
The little fantasy unwound the thread of plot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
which introduced the real play; but when the
curtain went down there was no enthusiastic applause.
The audience was expectant; but did
not wholly understand it. And this was as it
should be; the intent of that little prologue
was merely to whet the appetite for the real
play.
</p>
<p>
“The Spring Road” ran its three acts through
with unvarying success. The applause grew
more pronounced; the interest of the audience
grew deeper. The fact that a young girl had
written the text of the play became harder and
harder to believe as the evening lengthened.
</p>
<p>
At the end—when the general lights went out,
one by one upon the stage and left the two principal
characters in the radiance of the spot light
alone—and when this dimmed slowly and finally
went out, the silence of the audience was momentous.
</p>
<p>
Jess, in the wings, clinging to her chum,
waited, scarcely breathing, for the verdict. Had
it failed? Had the little lesson she had tried
to teach, and the pretty story she had told, failed
to “get over?”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly there was a roar of delight from the
back of the hall. Some of the older boys of
Central High had managed to get tickets to this
first performance, and, led by big Griff, they began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
to chant the well-known yell of Central
High.
</p>
<p>
But <em>that</em> was not what Jess waited for. That
was school loyalty. She had expected that.
</p>
<p>
As the thunder of the boys’ applause began
to wane there was another sound which reached
the ears of those listening behind the curtain.
A steady, sharp clapping of hands; then joined
by a shuffling of feet. The great mass of the
audience was applauding.
</p>
<p>
The curtain went up, and the whole company
appeared. It rose and rose again, at last to display
only the principals, down to the final two who
had closed the play. But that was not enough.
</p>
<p>
They could hear Dr. Agnew’s heavy voice
growling somewhere out in the darkness of the
auditorium:
</p>
<p>
“Author! Author! Bring her out!”
</p>
<p>
The boys took up the demand. They even
called on Jess Morse by name, and hitched that
name to the battle cry of their athletic field.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got to go!” cried Laura, giving her
chum a push. “You’ve got to, Jess!”
</p>
<p>
And so Jess Morse stepped forward, modestly,
bashfully, and faced the great audience. Tears
half blinded her, but she bowed as she had been
taught. And all the time she tasted the first
intoxicating draught of Fame!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
But that was not quite the end of it all. Mr.
Monterey, of the Centerport Opera House, was
in a seat down in front that evening. He never
was seen to applaud once; but on Saturday evening,
when the play was repeated for the general
public to attend, he came again and this time
brought a stranger who paid quite as close
attention to Jess’s play as did Mr. Monterey
himself.
</p>
<p>
After the performance and before Jess and
Laura started for home with their escorts, they
heard that the stranger with the local manager
was a very famous New York producer. He
had come especially to see “The Spring Road.”
</p>
<p>
And when Jess arrived home she found the
gentleman, with Mr. Monterey, conferring with
her mother in their little sitting room.
</p>
<p>
“I assure you,” said Mrs. Morse, proudly,
“the play is practically Josephine’s own work.
It is her idea, clothed in her own language. I
am pleased that you find it so admirable for a
child to have written——”
</p>
<p>
“It is admirable—in spots—for anybody to
have written,” said the New York gentleman.
“And this is the young lady?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Morse introduced Jess.
</p>
<p>
“You are the budding playwright?” suggested
the stranger.
</p>
<p>
“I am not so sure of that,” replied Jess,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
troubled a little. “I wanted the prize Mrs.
Kerrick offered, and I did my best.”
</p>
<p>
“And your best is very good—remarkably
good,” declared the producer. “I have come to
see you and your mother about it. I want you
to let me have the right to produce the play.
Monday I will come with a contract; meanwhile
I want Mrs. Morse to accept this check—which
Mr. Monterey will endorse for me—to bind the
agreement. I take a sort of option on the play,
as it were,” he said, and he handed the check to
Jess.
</p>
<p>
“You do not mean it?” gasped the girl.
</p>
<p>
“I certainly do,” said the other, rising.
“Your play is not like the work of a professional
playwright; but a professional writer of plays
can take your work and whip it into shape——And
I am willing to show my confidence in its
final success by risking that sum upon it to start
with.”
</p>
<p>
Jess looked then at the check. It was another
two hundred dollars. Jess shut her eyes tight
for a moment; then she opened them again to be
sure she was not dreaming.
</p>
<p>
When she opened them she really believed she
saw Poverty fly out of the window!

camp and while traveling. She knows girls of to-day
thoroughly—their likes and dislikes—and
knows that they demand almost as much action as
do the boys. And she knows humor—good, clean
fun and plenty of it.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
